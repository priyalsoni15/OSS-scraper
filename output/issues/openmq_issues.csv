I am using Open Message Queue 4.1

An error occured configuring the logging system: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError:
/u01/work/openmq/mq/lib/libimqutil.so: libc.so.1: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory

ldd libimqutil.so
libc.so.1 => not found

I have reproduced the problem on our RedHat AS3 production environment and my
Fedora Core 6 environment.

If I create a symlink of libc.so.1 -> libc-2.5.so and do

ldd libimqutil.so

I then get

./libimqutil.so: /lib64/libc.so.1: version `SUNW_1.1' not found (required by
./libimqutil.so)
libc.so.1 => /lib64/libc.so.1 (0x00002aaaaaad6000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x0000555555554000)

Not sure what is going on here, but it looks like MQ is not usable on any common
linux system.

libimqutil.so provides support for native integration on solaris and support
functionality like support for syslog, the ability to hide a password when it is
being typed in, the ability . At this point that type of integration with the
native logging system is not provided for linux. The library has not been ported
to linux.

On linux you should not have a limimqutil.so (if you do, you may have a solaris
install and should remove the native libraries)

However, the inability to load libimqutil.so should not affect the ability of
the product to run on other platforms. (the features supplied such as native
logging will not be available). It may generate a logging message but should not
cause a failure.

If you are unable to start or run the server on Linux you are probably running
into a seperate issue. (it is tested on several flavors of linux)

Can you attach the log file ?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NTk3MA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It also does not come with a liqimqutil.so. The shared objects it does come with appear valid. For
example:

ldd libnss3.so
linux-gate.so.1 => (0xffffe000)
libsoftokn3.so (0xf7f46000)
libplc4.so (0xf7f41000)
libplds4.so (0xf7f3e000)
libnspr4.so (0xf7f0c000)
libpthread.so.0 => /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0xf7ede000)
libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0xf7eda000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0xf7d9d000)
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x56555000)

Comparid this to 4.1, I get:

ldd libnss3.so
./libnss3.so: /lib64/libc.so.1: version `SUNW_0.7' not found (required by ./libnss3.so)
/usr/bin/ldd: line 116: 13942 Segmentation fault LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 LD_WARN=
LD_BIND_NOW= LD_LIBRARY_VERSION=$verify_out LD_VERBOSE= ""$@""

So, in summary it looks like this bug is:

1\. You should not be packaging solaris only shared objects with the Linux version of mq
2\. The shared objects that should be packaged in the linux version are wrong - maybe solaris versions
based on the SUNW_0.7 error that comes up
3\. We run on amd64\. There is an amd64 subdirectory in bin and lib. What are we supposed to do here?
Copy those binaries over the top of those in the bin and lib directories?
4\. You should have linux specific release notes informing the user of the facilities that are not included.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NTk3Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Hi,

If you have a lib/amd64 subdir in your distribution, then it most likely is the
Solaris X86 bits. That would explain why libimqutil.so exists in the lib
directory. We do not install a libimqutil.so for linux.

I don't have 4.1 B17 around but my 4.1 B35 and 4.1 B36 linux builds do not
contain lib/amd64 nor a lib/libimqutil.so.

Try reinstalling the mq4_1-binary-Linux_X86*.jar again on RH Linux with the
latest build. It could've been a bad linux bundle that was named incorrectly.

Thanks,

I just found out that mq/src/solaris/etc/imq-linux.sh included information that
supposed to help integration with the chkconfig tool:

#!/bin/sh
#

1.  imq This starts and stops the MQ Broker
    #
2.  chkconfig: 35 52 15

However chkconfig needs at least one additional line in the begining of the
script to work correctly. You should modify the file like:

#!/bin/sh
#

1.  imq This starts and stops the MQ Broker
    #
2.  chkconfig: 35 52 15
3.  description: Message Queue
    #

This way the script can be handeled by chkconfig.

Small issue, I know, but it might help ![](https://java.net/jira/images/icons/emoticons/tongue.gif)

The imqadmin startup script installed with glassfish generates

using bash.

Hi,

The imqadmin script in GF sources ../lib/imqinit which then sources
../etc/imqenv.conf.
My imqenv.conf has this value set:
IMQ_DEFAULT_VARHOME=/home/nakata/SUNWappserver/domains/domain1/imq

imqinit takes that value and sets it to $imq_varhome.

My command then uses the imq_varhome value correctly without the need
of an ""export"". Since the scripts fork the shell script the environments
stays within the shell.

My final command is:
/home/nakata/SUNWappserver/jdk/bin/java -cp
./../lib/imqadmin.jar:./../lib/fscontext.jar:/usr/j2se/opt/javahelp/lib/jhall.jar:./../lib/help:/home/nakata/SUNWappserver/hadb/4/lib/hadbjdbc4.jar
-Dimq.home=./.. -Dimq.varhome=/home/nakata/SUNWappserver/domains/domain1/imq
-Dimq.libhome=./../lib com.sun.messaging.jmq.admin.apps.console.AdminConsole

and you can see imq.varhome uses $imq_varhome which is the correct value.

The ""export"" is only needed if that value is needed outside the imqadmin shell
which it isn't. It is only needed within the imqadmin script.

Perhaps you can double check your values in imq/etc/imqenv.conf or echo values
within imq/lib/imqinit and imq/bin/imqadmin.

thanks,
jill","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjAyMQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

After
some effort the addapter seems to deploy allright, but when a web app tries to
access a TopicConnection from the adapter via JNDI I consitently get a
ClassCastException on line 282 of ConnectionFactory Addapter (in
_allocateTopicConnection()). I'll attatch a full stack trace. I guess it's
something to do with OC4Js connection pool handling mechanisms, even though I've
set the connection pool to none.

Exclude from 4.5 since this is not a requirement for Glassfish 3.1.

Possible workarounds are to use the GenericJMSRA resource adapter

or the JMSJCA resource adapter
[https://jmsjca.dev.java.net/](https://jmsjca.dev.java.net/)

Both RAs will work with Open Message Queue and are in principle intended to be

Maven. A project that does not make it's libraries available via Maven is very difficult to work with and
will be actively avoided by a significant percentage of the development community.

The ehcache project is adding JMS support right now and is having to manually install the imq.jar as it
is not available in any Maven module. Please add to one of the Sun Maven repositories.

Doing this for mq 4.3 and on is ok as this is the new version that new development will be targeting
anyway.

To be very specific, I and anyone else using Open MQ needs to be able to declare a dependency like so:

<dependency>
<groupId>com.sun.messaging</groupId>
<artifactId>imq</artifactId>
<version>4.3</version>
<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

There are currently three Sun Maven repositories I use. To add all of them to you Maven project so that
you could resolve the above you do:

<repositories>
<repository>
<id>java.net</id>
<url>[http://download.java.net/maven/1](http://download.java.net/maven/1)</url>
<layout>legacy</layout>

Please, please add this to mq4.3\. It is trivial.

from a queue).

Simple setup with multiple standalone clients producing (a lot) of text messages
into the queue and 3 MDB's listening to the same queue shows that only 2 MDB's
are invoked by glassfish/mq at a time (concurrently).

I tried playing with maxNumActiveConsumers set to -1 and consumerFlowLimit to 1

*   same thing - glassfish/mq (as per server.log) is creating only 2 consumers at
    a time.

Please, close the issue. The problem was in producer's ability to feed enough
messages in a queue. Too much work was spent creating
connection->session->destination->message(s) in each producer's thread. By
creating connection globally and delegating session->destination->message(s)
creation one are able to feed queue properly and see how glassfish/mq is
creating enough mdb instances to service incoming messages in parallel.

This would be useful for smaller applications were you do not want to have to

needed to implement the HTTP tunnel and you wanted both the Servlet Container

a lot. when you are used to this (glassfish for example does this) it is very
very usefull for debugging issues as well as turning off anoying messages that
you dont want to see.

this thread gives a brief idea on how this could e.g. be usefull. there are a

should be possible to drain a broker in a conventional cluster easilly.

AS IT IS TODAY:
when a broker becomes corrupted in a conventional cluster i as glassfish
administrator have no clue which broker serves which connections in an appserver
in a cluster. therefor i have to put the broker into quiesce mode and kill all
producers of the broker by listing them manually with

imqcmd list cxn
and
imqcmd destroy cxn

this is a very error prune process when dealing with hundreds of connections.
therefore a broker should support killing connections by e.g. type (consumer /
producer)

any info on ETA for this feature ?
right now we have implemented separate ""ping thread"" schema with use of pthread
mutex and conditional variables holding/controlling access to
multiple-thread-shared MQConnectionHandle object - when there is an error
getting access to MQ server, ping-thread takes over and tries to re-establish
new connection.

market. A business aliance now tries to solve this by implemented a standard
protocol for MOMs: AMQP (see amqp.org). As openess should be one of the topmost
targest of a product called ""OPEN MQ"", as a user of this product I demand for
first class support of AMQP in OpenMQ. Moreover, I appeal that Sun Microsystems
takes a seat in amqp.org's board to control the further development of this
standard. It is not acceptable that in near future there will be a lot of
interoperable products and Sun Microsystem, as the inventor of the de-facto MOM

4.2, but with the 4.3 version exhibits the same issue again.

Basically you cannot use selectors on header fields like JMSMessageID or
JMSTimestamp because the headers don't always load. The behavior is different
for custom properties since there is a recovery path in the code.

The problem occurs randomly and this makes me think of GC operation (there is a
softreference to the packet). I will include the relevant code below:

public synchronized HashMap getHeaders() {
if (headers == null) {
if (destroyed || invalid)

{ return new HashMap(); }
Packet pkt = getPacketObject();
assert pkt != null;
headers = new HashMap();
if (pkt == null) {
if (DEBUG) { Globals.getLogger().log(Logger.DEBUG,""no packet for ""+ ""non-destroyed message "" + msgid); }
return headers;

I did not see any existing issues with a search for 'postgresql' so assumed one
had not yet been opened.

Using PostgreSQL 8.3.6\. ""imqdbmgr create tbl"" can be used successfully to
initialize the database for an HA broker configuration. However, imqbrokerd
fails with this exception:

The reason is that ""AS"" is being omitted in the select clause alias ""sTbl.ID

As noted in linked forum post there is a workaround via source code modification
but wanted to ensure it was captured in the issue tracker.

UTF-8 and the C-API (should) only accept UTF-encoded strings some helf-
functionality would be desirable

One solution would be that the API always accepted 8-bit characters for input
and then did encoding internally and when accessing strings the API could
decode the string into 8-bit-characters (and report error if the UTF-8-encoded
value doesn't fit into a 8-bit-character string)

Another solution would be to double up the interfaces/functions and have
functions like MQSetStringProperty along with MQSetUTF8Property or perhaps
MQSetLatinProperty with MQSetUnicodeProperty (where the second one demanded a
UTF-8-encoded string) and MQGetDestinationNameAsString with
MQGetDestinationNameAsUTF or something etc.

Yet another solution, and the most likely, would be to provide som standalone-
help-functionality like MQEncodeWideString and MQEncodeNarrowString along with
MQDecodeToWide and MQDecodeToNarrow (where the last version somehow must report
an error if a decoded value doesn't fit into a (narrowed) 8-bit-value)

client throws an exception while processing a message, the OpenMQ broker will
attempt to redeliver the message indefinitely, with no delay.
It would be useful to be able to define a maximum number of redelivery attempts,
and an interval between each delivery attempt.

The most specific use case to illustrate this:
A client is in some state where the message will always fail, and thus always be
resent by the broker. Manual intervention is the only solution to stop this cycle.

The ActivationSpec properties endpointExceptionRedeliveryXXX handles the case when a MDB onMessage() throws Exception;

For the case of MDB setRollbackOnly (e.g. in case of processing error in Java EE container managed transaction), please see #134;

For standalone client, OpenMQ's implementation in case of MessageListener.onMessage() throwing RuntimeException conforms to JMS specification 1.1 section 4.5.2 Asynchronous Delivery - that is, for transacted session, it's the client application controls the the message redelivery by Session.rollback.

[https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4322](https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4322)

Both in GF v2 and v3 port unification is supported for HTTP, HTTPS (and possibly
IIOP). A ProtocolFinder detects which protocol connects on a given TCP port and
then delegates handling to a ProtocolHandler. See
[http://weblogs.java.net/blog/jfarcand/archive/2006/11/one_port_to_rul.html](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/jfarcand/archive/2006/11/one_port_to_rul.html)

OpenMQ should be able to participate in port unification. This would support
this use case related to applicaton client containers (ACC):
1\. HTTP to download via Java Webstart
2\. IIOP to get JNDI admin objects from server
3\. OpenMQ to send/receive messages to/from server

The JavaWS client could run on a remote site and only one port has to opened in
the firewall instead of 3.

(TemporaryTopicImpl) extends TemporaryDestination, which extends Destination,
which extends AdministeredObject, the constructor for which looks for
configuration data from properties files. It is looking for
Destination_defaults.properties, Destination_types.properties, and
Destination_labels.properties, but these are not included in the source tree or
any of the jars. Because these files cannot be found, the AdministeredObject
constructor calls setDefaultConfiguration(). An implementation for this is
found in Destination. However I see a memory leak in this method. It creates
three new Properties objects, and puts some String objects into those. When
profiling the app in NetBeans, I find that these Properties objects and the
Strings inside them are never garbage collected. My app is only holding the
TemporaryTopic object in a local variable so I'm pretty sure it's not a coding
error on my part (although I'd be happy to be proved wrong on this). Presumably
a reference to the TemporaryTopic is being held somewhere else, otherwise I'd
expect garbage collection to take care of things. Because I call the method
that uses TemporaryTopic on a regular basis, the memory leak becomes significant
after a few hours.

Hi jeppehans,
Please can you provide some more info on your usage of temp dests.
Temporary destinations are held by the connection that created them. They
should be automatically cleaned up when the connection closes. Are you
creating lots of temp destinations on the same connection?
If so, are you calling calling TempDestination.delete()?

Although I was unable to reproduce this in testing, it is still definitely an issue in our production
environment. The only noticeable difference in the two environments is message content/size.

We are still using 4 cluster nodes. I am wondering if it would be wise to utilize a master broker that no
clients connect to directly, in order to alleviate some load.

Any other suggestions?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjM4Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When a broker startup, it needs to sync up with the master broker first, yes
the master broker's load will be up, and if there are messages already waiting
for remote consumers, as soon as the sync is done, the messages will be
flowing to the remote broker. If you have producers on master broker that have
remote consumers or consumers on the master broker that consume messages
remotely, it will be helpful to miminize master broker's JMS service.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjM4NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

FYI, here is the dst list with the -tmp option during our normal operational state. We use spring for a
lot of things, but I talked to our software architect and he said we manually create our temporary
destinations. We don't use spring for this. He said we could provide a test case if necessary.

We are using 4.4 build 9\.

Occasionally, after a broker restart, the broker seems to be unable to rejoin the cluster. The destinations
all appear, and the query bkr command shows the broker as active, but not all consumers/producers
appear. Some messages will only work in one direction (aproducer on the broker can send messages out,
but can't consume messages on the same destination). The isolation is assymetrical (some brokers report
the isolated broker as active and some not).

So far, the only fix we have found for this is to shut down all brokers, remove their fs370 directory, and
restart them.

Ok, we had a major issue last night and I grabbed a ton of data.

The executive summary is that we had brokers in at least some stage of isolation. For example, some
brokers would list a destination with x number of consumers and another broker would list a destination
with y number of consumers. Since this was a topic, not all the messages would reach all consumers,
because some brokers didn't recognize that they existed.

I will attach the results from the imqcmd list dst command, as well as query bkr on the master broker. I
also did a kill -QUIT to create a stack trace and use jmap to create a heap dump. I will attach as many of
these to this bug as I can.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjQyMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We are using 4.4 build 9\.

Occasionally we observe that the numbers presented in the ""list dst"" command don't seem to match up.
For example, 3 brokers will say under the Msgs section, count=0, remote=0, unack=0, but a fourth will
say count=0, remote=277, unack=0\. This 277 will not change for weeks at a time. The only way to ""reset""
it seems to be to stop it and remove its fs370 directory.

We don't use persistent messages, so it is unclear why this happens.

I managed to duplicate this error in a test environment. I had two brokers on
each side of a 166ms latency link, and a producer/consumer pair on each side as
well. I used no-ack mode to send 750msgs/sec to a topic from each producer and
had each consumer subscribe to the topic. Broker 1 was the master for this
cluster. After a short while, the producer connected to the master gave the
following error:

[2009-09-03 18:14:23,153] ERROR [main]
com.adconion.jms.testclient.SimpleProducerApp: connect or send failed

com.sun.messaging.jms.ResourceAllocationException: [C4096]: Destination is full
and is rejecting new messages: amg.test.topic user=guest,
broker=broker1.test.com:7676(51398)

This sounded odd to me, because the topic had flow control enabled. After this,
using the imqcmd list dst command gave the following output:

That's maybe hard to read, but it shows ""remote"" at 4444\. On the other broker
it shows all zeroes. Consumers will consume no more messages.

I am assuming that the error message actually means that a broker has reached
it's maximum total messages (system wide and not for a specific destination).

I also did this using 4.4 build 15 this time.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjQ2Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

What was the output 'imqcmd query bkr' ?
What was the ouptut 'imqcmd query dst' on amg.test.topic ?

What do you mean by ""used no-ack mode to send .. to a topic from each producer

You were sending NON_PERSISTENT messages, correct ? Did you use message

What were the configurations for your client connection factories ? Both broker

If you stop the producers, then restart (without -reset store option and without

I will attach the output of those commands so maybe it will be easier to read...

In my test, I am using NO_ACKNOWLEDGE mode for all producers and subscribers.
We are using NON-PERSISTENT messages with no TTL.

The consumer config was like this:

<bean id=""messageLoggingListenerContainer""
class=""org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer"">

<property name=""autoStartup"" value=""false"" />
<property name=""sessionAcknowledgeMode"" value=""32768"" />
<property name=""cacheLevelName"" value=""CACHE_CONSUMER"" />
</bean>

The producer's config is like this:

<bean id=""producerJmsTemplate""
class=""org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate"">
<!-- need rawJmsConnectionFactory for NO_ACKNOWLEDGE mode. -->

<property name=""deliveryPersistent"" value=""false"" />
<property name=""sessionAcknowledgeMode"" value=""32768"" />
</bean>

I restarted the master broker, and the ""remote"" messages went away, but as soon
as I did it, I realized I should have had some producers/consumers running to
better simulate when we tried this in our production environment. In
production, the messages wouldn't go away.

D'oh, i restarted before querying the destination for you. I'll post query bkr
output though, and the broker configs momentarily.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjQ2NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I was able to reproduce the funny numbers in list dst again today with build 9, but am having troubles
with build 15 and 16, it may be fixed.

With build 9, I had 4 brokers, two on each side of a 155ms latency link. I had both a consumer and a
producer producing 500 msgs/sec attached to each broker. Fairly quickly, 3 of the brokers had a
""count"" that was stuck (consumers couldn't consume any more, but there were still messages listed
under count) and one broker had a ""remote"" that was stuck.

The numbers didn't add up, either. 300 on one broker, 80 on another, 110 on the third, all with zero
""remote"". The last had 87 ""remote"" but count=0\.

Hm, I tried build 16 with the same config as prior and it looks like it suffered poorer performance and it
didn't keep up with the producers and the topic eventually hit the configured 500 message maximum I
had, and when that happened, the numbers skewed in a manner similar to build 9\.

It may have something to do with the fact that I left the consumers and producers on, trying to connect,
even though the broker was off. This way, when it comes on, it has clients connecting before it ever has a
chance to sync up with the master.

It also seems to make a difference how many brokers I have. 3 or less exhibits the problem much less. The
issue really shows itself with 4 brokers.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjQ3Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

a JMSException is thrown but from the message it is difficult to understand what
happened:

error occurred. :[500] [B4117]: Unexpected Broker Exception: [Unexpected Error
processing message]

This type of issue with a selector leads to an internal error in the broker,
which causes the ""[B4117]: Unexpected Broker Exception"" message to be logged by
both the broker and the client. The broker's log will also include a
ArithmeticException in the stacktrace, but at the client side the root cause is
not logged.

In the broker's log.txt:

(This is on GFv2 so the line numbers might not match anymore.)

With the patch that I'm going to attach, this case will be treated as a syntax
error, and the messages will change as follows:

Client application log:

multiplication of two integers and a subsequent cast to a long led to
IllegalArgumentException because the value had become negative.

[https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=7979](https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=7979)

For example:
timer.schedule(this,timeout * 1000);

schedule() takes a long, but if 'timeout' is bigger than MAX_INT/1000,
the value will become negative.

Searching through the V3 source code I found many similar cases. I have fixed
them all in GlassFish, and will attach diffs to fix them in MQ code.

Some of the 'timeout' variables might never reach a big enough value, or
code might not be used any more, but as it's better safe than sorry I've
addressed them in the attached diff (added 'L' to integer 1000).

Session,glassfishrobot,6104758,glassfishrobot,,CLOSED,2009-10-30T12:53:48Z,2017-05-09T17:05:33Z,"I noticed this problem when using the version of Sun MQ which ships with GES
2.13\. ALthough we are using a Sun supported version of Glassfish and Sun
Message Queue, I believe that the open source version of MQ is the same and so
I am posting this issue here. I have also opened a Sun ticket for this - ticket
71896734

Setup:
You have an existing durable subscription to a topic destination. ClientId = X,
SubscriptionName = S. The consumer should be inactive. The current number
of messages on the destination = 0.

Steps:
Open a new connection, a new transacted session, and a new producer on the same
destination D, using the same clientId X.
It is important that you use the same clientId ""X"" as the inactive consumer.
Publish one message. Commit the session
Close the producer, session and connection.
At this time, you would have expected that the message would have got persisted
on the destination for the inactive client ""X"".

Observation:
a) The number of messages on the destination remain at 0.
b) The JMS server side log contains a error message:

Reference already gone for <msg id of published message>

c) If you use a non-transacted session, then the message does get persisted to
the topic.

Attachments:
1) Sample java class that will create a transacted session and produce a
message. All values such as JNDI settings, etc are hard coded in the java file.
The code sets the connection client id to be the value ""undefined""
2) Output of client when running in debug mode (imq.debug.all)

Pre-Requisite Conditions Before Running Java Test Code:
You must somehow create a durable consumer with clientId ""undefined"" on the
destination before run the java class.

Software Versions:
This was tested using JDK 1.5 and 1.6 on the client side. We are using the
follwing Sun MQ version:

Sun Java(tm) System Message Queue 4.3
Sun Microsystems, Inc.
Version: 4.3 (Build 7-g)
Compile: Fri Nov 7 18:14:54 PST 2008

with JDK 1.6.0_07\.

This version of MQ is the version that ships with Glassfish Enterprise Server
2.13.

I have 2 brokers with a 160ms latency between them. I have a consumer
and producer attached to a topic on each broker, and each producer is producing 500 messages per
second with persistence turned off and using noack mode. This should be a max of 1000 messages/sec
on the topic.

The topic was set up with this config:

imqcmd update dst -t t -n amg.test.topic -o useDMQ=false -o limitBehavior=REMOVE_OLDEST -o
maxNumMsgs=500

With this running, within seconds I see these error messages:

And one of my producers disconnects. I can't see anywhere that the message count has reached 5k
when i use the list dst command, and the ""maxNumMsgs=500"" config should have limited that topic to
500 messages anyway, preventing this from happening. Worst case scenario, the broker should be
dropping older messages because of the ""REMOVE_OLDEST"".

This supposed to be logged at debug level. It means on removing the message the
message has already been removed from the destionation. The log message has
been changed to be more self-explanatory and to be logged at debug level in
4.4u1 on Sep 22 2009 which happened before 4.4u1 build3 (in Oct 2009). So it
appears that you were using a build before 4.4u1 build3\. Please upgrade to the
latest 4.4u1 build for all your brokers and run your test again. Thanks.

I assure you this was done on 4.4u1_b5(rc3). I downloaded it from here:

[http://download.java.net/mq/open-mq/4.4u1/b5-rc3/openmq4_4-binary-Linux_X86.zip](http://download.java.net/mq/open-mq/4.4u1/b5-rc3/openmq4_4-binary-Linux_X86.zip)

To be safe, I downloaded it again and did an md5sum against the file i downloaded before and got the
same thing.

Yes, I do have this set. However, I am only sending messages on a single topic, with max messages on
that topic set to 500\. How can I reach the 5k limit when my only destination has a max of 500?

Also, if you look at the list dst output above, you can see that the ""remote"" count on app15.muc's
broker says ""4095"". These messages don't appear to actually exist anywhere (they aren't on etl3.lax's
broker, so where are they?). Also, how can ""remote"" on the destination be that high when ""max"" is set
to 500? This makes no sense to me.

On top of all that, because Issue 30's fix should be in this build, the remote count shouldn't be greater
than the ""count"" anyway.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjY0MQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

So I removed the system message limit (set it to -1, infinity). I have 2 brokers in my setup, running
4.4u1b5, a producer and consumer on each broker and am generating approximately 500 msgs/sec
per producer (total 1000 per sec on a test topic), 160ms latency between brokers.

I let it run for ~1 hour and noticed the heap was slowly increasing in utilization via the jconsole. So I let
it run till it ran out of heap space and saw this error message:

Exception in thread ""RMI TCP Connection(idle)"" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

Java is still running, it shows up in a process list, but the broker never responds. This is happening on
the master broker. The other broker is still up and responding, but it thinks the master is still up. All
connections to the master just time out and more entries like the above appear in the log.

So, I think either the system message counter problem DOES use up some amount of memory, or else I
am now hitting a different memory leak and removing the system message max has allowed me to see
it now.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjY2Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

between them, for a total of 4 brokers. One of the brokers has mysteriously restarted itself on 12-19-
2009 at around 9:04GMT. This seems to have confused the master broker in such a way that it was not
marking messages on two of the destinations as read, which caused the destinations to fill to their max
defined message limit. The interesting tidbits are as follows.

First, on jms2.lax:

So at 09:04, jms2 seems to have had some sort of stomp connection, stomp stopped, then the entire
broker restarted itself, sending goodbyes to the other brokers.

The master broker saw this:

Simply, the master broker had a very odd message, ""Cannot order unordered items"" after jms2.lax
decided to restart itself, which seemed to confuse it enough that jms1.muc and jms2.muc stopped
getting responses from it in a timely manner.

The jms restart at 17:18GMT put everything back into a working state. So the question is, why did
jms2.lax decide to restart itself? We had no one running any kind of stomp clients on this broker at that
time.

Hello,

I am not sure of the cause of the broker shutdown of jms2.lax. I think the
stomp server messages are just a consequence of the broker shutting down.
Running the broker in debug mode would provide more output about the reasons
for shutdown. One thing I noticed is that the broker logs are full of errors
like:

Under certain un-recoverable error conditions, broker can restart itself if not running in-process, which is expected. When that happens, broker logging has been improved to always indicate a self-triggered restart, which should help to distinguish it from a restart triggered externally, e.g. certain system signal/event. Please reopen if the issue is noticed again and suspect a broker issue.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjcxNQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

multiple MQ connection pools – we end up having two threads modifying a hash
map at the same time, and the hash map gets corrupted, resulting in the hash map
code going into an infinite loop. (That is the classic symptom of the JDK hash
map code when used by two threads at the same time.)

The appserver is setting up two connection pools and initializing connections
within the pool. At the appserver level, that initialization is synchronized at
the pool level. But in the MQ code, the connection factory has only a single
instance of IMQDirectService that is shared between the factories. Hence,
multiple threads attempt to call IMQDirectService.createDirectConnection at the
same time, and the call to localConnectionList.put() at the same time by two
threads corrupts the hash map.

inconformant to JSR-914)

The problem is that both methods will NOT wait until message consuming
(onMessage, receive methods) has finished, instead methods called from onMessage
(such as rollback, commit or acknowledge) will throw
""javax.jms.IllegalStateException: [C4055]: Resource in conflict. Concurrent
operations on a session."".

This is possibly not conformant to the JMS specification, see JSR-914 ""4.4.1
Closing a Session"", paragraph 4:
When session close is invoked, it should not return until its message
processing has been shut down in an orderly fashion. This means that none of
its message listeners are running, and that if there is a pending receive, it has
returned with either null or a message.

On the other hand, it also says:
Closing a transacted session must roll back its transaction in progress. Closing
a client-acknowledged session does NOT force an acknowledge.

This is IMHO somewhat contradictory but I think the current behavior doesn't
help anybody - the problem is that I'm usually _forced_ to call ""rollback"" if
I'm not committing, otherwise the message will be implicitely committed with the
next transaction, so ""closing"" from another thread will introduce a _third_ case
in ""onMessage"" _and_ require my own synchronization (since I may not close a
Session from ""onMessage"", which also hints at ""stop"" blocking until ""onMessage""
has finished).
This behavior also makes proting from other MQs (tested with Sonic, JBoss)
considerably more difficult as they're behaving as expected.
If ""close"" just waited for the currently active consumers to complete and not
allowing new ones this would ease things considerably.

This bug is present at least in OpenMQ 4.3, 4.4 and 4.4UR1 (tested all). Test
program attached below.

private void testMqBug() throws Exception {
com.sun.messaging.ConnectionFactory cf=new
com.sun.messaging.ConnectionFactory();
final javax.jms.Connection c=cf.createConnection();
final Session s=c.createSession(true, Session.SESSION_TRANSACTED);
// final Session s=c.createSession(false, Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE);
final Queue q=s.createQueue(""PhoenixTestQueue"");
final MessageConsumer mc=s.createConsumer(q);
final AtomicBoolean consuming=new AtomicBoolean(false);
mc.setMessageListener(new MessageListener() {
public void onMessage(Message rawMsg) {
consuming.set(true);
System.out.println(""consuming started"");
try

{ TextMessage msg=(TextMessage)rawMsg; System.out.println(""Got message: ""+msg.getText()); Thread.sleep(20000); }

catch(Exception ex)

{ System.out.println(""Exception while consuming messages""); }

finally {
try

{ s.rollback(); // rawMsg.acknowledge(); }

catch(JMSException jmsex)

{ System.out.println(""Error rolling back JMS message""); jmsex.printStackTrace(); }

consuming.set(false);
System.out.println(""consuming finished"");
}
}
});
c.start();
while(true) {
Thread.sleep(100);
if(consuming.get())

{ System.out.println(""Closing session""); s.close(); }

}
}

As I just found out, the root cause of this is another possible (though in this
case I'm quite sure) Spec violation, again, JSR-914 say, in section ""4.4.1
Closing a Session"":
When a session is closed, there is no need to close its constituent message
producers and consumers. The session close is sufficient to signal the JMS
provider that all resources for the session should be released.

With OpenMQ, however, one needs to close the consumers BEFORE closing the
session to avoid the ""javax.jms.IllegalStateException"". This behavior doesn't
seem to conform to the quoted paragraph.
For reproduction use the test-program attached to the request and insert
""mc.close();"" in the ""while""-loop just before ""s.close();"" - the
exception/logwarning will disappear.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2Njc4NA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Steps:

*   Uninstall Sun JDK from the test system

*   Install Oracle JRockit VM (JDK 6 u14)

*   Start MQ standalone installer
    C:> cscript installer.vbs -java_home <Jrockit_HOME>

*   Installer fails to start up.

*   Reinstall Sun JDK and Rerun the installer - it works fine. Looks like the
    OpenMQ installer has hard dependency on ""Sun"" JDK.

We run OpenMQ4.4u1\. We have a 4 broker
cluster, 2 brokers each in different colocation facilities. There is a 160ms
latency between the two. I will attach the configs for the brokers and the
script we use to manually create destinations, that way you can see the config
for each of them.

The executive summary is that we have ""-o useDMQ=false"" set on all destinations
and are no longer using temporary destinations for anything.

The issue that we are seeing is that seemingly randomly we will get the
following error message in stdout on one of the brokers in the colo that does
not have the master broker in it:

Shortly after that, we see a message about closing the session between the two
brokers, then this error message:

After that, it appears that the original broker is trying to connect to the
master broker, and the master broker is unable to process those messages. The
link stays ""broken"" until a restart. In the meantime, there are no error
messages in the other two brokers, which continue to forward messages like
always. This seems to result in topics filling up, due to consumers not marking
messages as read, according to the faulty brokers. Eventually, the whole system
breaks down, because we hit the destination message caps.

I will attach the relevant configs, the setup script, and the stdout of the two
brokers with issues. We have observed this behavior at least twice in the past
month.

Ok, so a few comments.

First, the ""unable to create destination"" is an expected message. It occurs
because our application uses a spring library that tries to create a
destination if it doesn't exist, but we have autocreation turned off. We see
these messages when we stop the broker, delete its fs370 directory (for a
completely clean restart) and bring it back up. We then use the destination
creation script to manually create all destinations. Until that happens, we
expect to see many messages of this type.

As for intermittent connectivity, yes, it is a WAN link that occasionally gets
~4% packet loss. However, this loss seems to only have affected these two
brokers, and not the other two. They ""weathered the storm"" just fine. I don't
understand why.

Lastly, if the other messages are benign, why do we observe a constantly rising
total system message count after these errors occur? There is obviously a
correlation between at least one of these messages and the constantly
increasing total message count. Every time we see these error patterns, we see
the message count start rising. It is as if a consumer isn't reading from a
topic, except that all consumers seem to be behaving as if they read all

the following message when passing null:

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: C4072[C4072]: Illegal property name - """" or
null.

Note that the actual message includes the key of the message (the msg Id is
therefore listed twice).

It's because of the following code:

String errorString = AdministeredObject.cr.getKString(AdministeredObject.
cr.X_BAD_PROPERTY_NAME);

throw new IllegalArgumentException(AdministeredObject.cr.
X_BAD_PROPERTY_NAME + errorString);

getKString looks up the message (which includes the message prefix in brackets)
and in the exception the message key a prefixed to it again.

Easy fix:

mq/src/share/java/com/sun/messaging/jmq/jmsclient/MessageImpl.java
String errorString = AdministeredObject.cr.getKString(AdministeredObject.
cr.X_BAD_PROPERTY_NAME);

*   throw new IllegalArgumentException(AdministeredObject.cr.

3\. Execute client app that makes 100.000 connections.

all messages are consumed from the queue without issue. It does not handle
multiple consumers fetching from a queue concurrently if the fetch limit is high
and all messages are not consumed from those fetched for that QueueSession. When
the fetched messages that were not consumed are put back onto the queue, if
another thread has been concurrently accessing the queue and found it to be empty,
it appears to set the current and next element to null, causing those messages
returned by the first thread to then get stuck on the queue.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2Njg4OQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The attached StatelessSessionConsumerEjbBean.java shows that it uses
Consumer.receive(1000). The timeout is too small to be used as an indication of
no message. Please increase the timeout.

The following test has been done on a MQ standalone client, all messages are
consumed:

1\. send 15000 messages to queue q0
2\. start a N-thread consumers client which consuming messages from q0
concurrently:
each thread does following repeatly:
1) create a AUTO_ACK JMS session and a consumer
2) receive 1 message using Consumer.receive()
3) close the consumer and the session

Tested on N=10, N=50 with either all sessions share 1 connection or each session
has a separate connection on a 8CPUx900MHz, a 4CPUx1281MHz Sparc machines.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2Njg5Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

from a queue synchronously. I am using OpenMQ 4.4 build 16 which comes bundled
with GlassFish 2.1.1\. My client app reads a single message from the queue via a
stateless session bean before releasing the session and is being run with
multiple concurrent consumers. The result is that each consumer picks up 1000
messages (default prefetch), consumes one, and then puts the remaining 999
messages back onto the queue. With multiple threads the queue eventually becomes
corrupted (due to a separate issue â€“ see
[https://mq.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=50](https://mq.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=50)).

I have set consumerFlowLimit to 1 on my queue (as well as on the connection pool
used within GlassFish), which I hoped would get around this problem and perhaps
improve performance, however this property appears to be ignored and each
consumer is still picking up 1000 messages from the queue.

During debugging I found the following code in IMQDirectService.addConsumer()
which explains this behaviour:
int size = -1;
....
/*

*   size (prefetch size) is not needed here since the broker is going to
*   call the client method with the messages, not simply dump packets
*   till a particular size is reached.
    */
    con = protocol.createConsumer(d, cxn,
    session, selector, clientId,
    durableName, noLocal, size,
    shared, new Object().toString(), acEnabled);

The size variable is eventually passed into ConsumerHandler.createConsumer()
where it is used to calculate prefetch. The hard-coded value of -1 effectively
means that the prefetch value set on the queue (i.e. consumerMessageFlow
property) is ignored:

int cprefetch = size;
int dprefetch = (wildcard ? -1 : (!shared
? d.getMaxPrefetch()
: d.getSharedConsumerFlowLimit()));

prefetch = (dprefetch == -1) ?
cprefetch :
(cprefetch == -1 ? cprefetch
: (cprefetch > dprefetch?
dprefetch : cprefetch));
c.setPrefetch(prefetch);

Now fixed (will be released in MQ 4.5 Milestone 2).

The queue property consumerFlowLimit (for an administratively-created queue), or
the broker property imq.autocreate.queue.consumerFlowLimit (for an auto-ccreated
queue) will now be used to configure the size of blocks in which messages are
pre-sent to the JMSRA direct mode client.

Note that although these properties have a similar behaviour to when TCP mode
clients are used, the behaviour is not identical, since flow control (in which
the broker pauses the delivery of messages and waits for a ""resume packet"" from
the client) is not required or performed when the direct mode client is used. In
particular, consumerFlowThreshold is not used to determine when the next ""block""
of messages needs to be pre-fetched. Instead, the next block of messages is
prefetched when the previous block is exhausted.

Note also that although the ""options"" parameter of the ManagedConnectionFactory
allows MQ connection factory properties to be specified, these are all ignored
when JMSRA direct mode is being used. In consequence, the connection factory
property imqConsumerFlow limit cannot be configured.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NjkxMg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

conventional cluster, any existing clients are automatically notified so their
addressList can be updated.

This allows existing clients to failover to newly-added brokers which they would
otherwise not be aware of.

This functionality is already present for enhanced clusters.

Since this would override any addressList already used by the client we may wish
to make this behaviour configurable by setting a connection factory property.

is cumbersome, because ConnectionFactory does not support either constructor or
setter injection of its properties. (It's slightly funny that a SUN project does
not follow JavaBeans conventions). Instead one has to use
factory.setProperty(String name, String value). To do this in Spring one has to
write a custom ConnectionFactoryFactoryBean that calls this method for all
properties.
Proposal: add a method setProperties(Map<String, String> properties) to
com.sun.messaging.AdministeredObject that iteraties over the map and calls
setProperty(String, String) for each entry. Then a Spring context could simply
look like this:

<bean id=""jmsConnectionFactory"" class=""com.sun.messaging.ConnectionFactory"">
<property name=""properties"">
<util:map>
<entry key=""imqAddressList"" value=""mq://localhost:7676/jms""/>
<entry key=""imqDefaultUsername"" value=""jmsuser""/>
<entry key=""imqDefaultPassword"" value=""secret""/>
</util:map>
</property>

an active/passive configuration over a shared filesystem. One node grabs the
global lock and the other node blocks until lock become available again (when
the first node stops or crashes). Clients have the URLs of both brokers in the
address list and will reconnect to the broker that has become active.
ActiveMQ supports this under the name 'Shared File System Master Slave' (see
[http://activemq.apache.org/shared-file-system-master-slave.html](http://activemq.apache.org/shared-file-system-master-slave.html)).
OpenMQ can very easily support this configuration too: it already has a global
instance lock var/mq/instances/imqbroker/lock. Currently, if OpenMQ cannot
acquire the lock it exists.
Proposal: Modify com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.util.LockFile to optionally
wait until it has acquired the lock. Add a configuration property to turn on
this behavior.

syslog. This ulimits support for logging to syslog to the Solaris platform.
Particularly on other Unix-like system such as Linux logging to syslog would be
very useful.
Plenty open source SyslogLogger implementations are available, e.g. log4,
logback or custom Loggers for java.util.logging.
Proposal: either reimplement the com.sun.messaging.jmq.util.log.SysLog class in
pure Java to send messages tot syslog via UDP,
or, preferably, add a Logger that delegates logging to log4j, logback, slf4j,
java.util.logging or similar.

The problem was reproduced against the OpenMQ bundled with Glassfish v3.

Reproduction:

1\. Prepare a disk(e.g. F drive.) whose free space is set to about 18M.

2\. Start broker

=====
E:\glassfish\imq\bin>imqbrokerd -varhome F:\imq
=====

3\. Start Glassfish app server
To change the settings of Java Message Service and JMS Resources as follows:
=====

*   Set Java Message Service Type to [REMOTE] (admin01.jpg)
*   Define [jms/MyQueueConnectionFactory] at Connection Factories,
    and set Transaction Support to [LocalTransaction]. (admin02.jpg)
*   Define [jms/MyQueue] at Destination Resources,
    and set name property to [JMSDEMOQueue]. (admin03.jpg)
    =====

4\. Deploy attached sender.war
5\. Access [http://localhost:8080/sender/](http://localhost:8080/sender/)
The messages will be sent.
6\. Push button several times and make the disk full.
The error message will be thrown at broker prompt.
=====
[06/5/2010:10:39:19 JST] ERROR [B4105]: Failed to persist interest list for
message 132-10.209.11.117(ce:d3:4:4f:fe:c4)-1911-1273109959515
=====

7\. Confirm the message of Unacknowledge remained in the queue.
=====
E:\glassfish\imq\bin>imqcmd list dst

One suggested fix plan that is target to glassfish v2 ur2.
Please see this suggestion below and give any comments.

------------
I have tested the OpenMQ with this fix and did not see any problem with minimal
tests.
Current Implementation:
1\. The VR file is growing with the allocateSize + RECORD_HEADER_SIZE.
2\. After growing the file it allocate the increased memory for storing the
messages and the VR FilePointer is also increasing.
3\. But this file size allocation is happening with allocateSize only.

It means the file size is increased but few space(RECORD_HEADER_SIZE) is not
allocated. That is why, send operation happens successfully because there is a
space in VR file. But fails while committing the message because this time
broker tries to write interests state and even though there is a space broker
tries to increase the file size and the exception occurs in broker.

File name: VRFileRAF.java
Method name: allocate(int size)
Line number: 293

288 if (remaining() < allocateSize)

{ 289 // grow file 290 growfile(allocateSize + RECORD_HEADER_SIZE); 291 }

292
293 record = getNewSlice(allocateSize);

The proposed 293 line will be:

293 record = getNewSlice(allocateSize + RECORD_HEADER_SIZE);

1\. The reason for passing 'allocateSize' not 'allocateSize + RECORD_HEADER_SIZE'
in below code is because the RECORD_HEADER_SIZE is allocated for the
lastrecordHeader (see VRFileRAF.getNewSliceAndWrite)

288 if (remaining() < allocateSize)

{ 289 // grow file 290 growfile(allocateSize + RECORD_HEADER_SIZE); 291 }

292
293 record = getNewSlice(allocateSize);

2\. The store does not attempt to pre-allocate space for a message's interest
states when persist a transacted message, therefore if disk is full, IOException
can happen when store message's interest.

3\. Since the message itself has been persisted, the message is not lost (it
should be re-routed when the broker restarts)

4\. For transacted sent Queue message, when persisting a message, space for its
interest state can be pre-allocated. This can be an enhancement for Queue messages","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NzA4MQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The metadata from the database (oracle in this case, and user's rights might be
higher than what is required) returns all table names.
In the method called getTableNamesFromDB a StringIndexOutOfBoundException is
thrown when a table named with one character (Â´AÂ´ in this case) is found and the
name is being parsed to check whether it starts with ""MQ""
line #864 in the 4.4u1 source code will throw the afore mentioned exception if

I suggest a check using String.startsWith(""MQ"") prior to adding the table to the
HashMap tableNames or a check to see whether the length of tableName>1

Even Vista is not there!

There seems to be a problem with the installer (for 4.4u2) on Windows 7 /
jdk1.6.0u21 (64bit). It's a rather ugly registry error coming from
installer.vbs, line 147 character 8\. Error message, loosely translated from my
local language: ""Illegal root in register key HKLM\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java
Runtime Environment\Currentversion."" Further, the error message says ""Code:
80070002"" and ""Source: WshShell.RegRead""

SiR

PS: I tried to search for this error, but found no issue for 4.4u2 whatsoever..
is that true or did I just fill out the search form incorrectly?

producer will check the flow control before sending.
When it is blocked, it will wait for its ProducerState instance like this (in
MessageProducerImpl.java):

private synchronized void checkFlowControl(Message message) {
while (flowLimit == 0 && ! isClosed) {
try

{ blocked = true; wait(); blocked = false; }

...
}

And the close() method of ProducerState looks like this:

protected synchronized void close() {
notifyAll();
}

Clearly, when a producer is closed, its related ProducerStates will also be
closed, which will notify the thread waiting on the ProducerState in
checkFlowControl(). In checkFlowControl(), if the producer is closed it should
not wait on ProducerState anymore.

Now we see the close() method of the producer:

public void close() throws JMSException {
...
try {
Enumeration enum2 = producerStates.elements();
while (enum2.hasMoreElements())

{ ProducerState ps = (ProducerState) enum2.nextElement(); ps.close(); // <-- the ProducerState is closed here, which will notify the thread waiting on it }

...
} finally

{ isClosed = true; }

}

Not until the ""finally"" block the ""isClosed"" flag is set to true. If a producer
thread has been waiting on a ProducerState, it will be notified by the call to
ProducerState's close() method first, then it checks the ""isClosed"" flag of the
Producer, and it might not have been set because the close method has not
finished. And the thread will wait for the ProducerState again but no one else
can notify it afterwards.

Possible solution: It should add a ""isShutdown"" flag and set to true in the
beginning of the close() method of Producer, and checkFlowControl() checks it instead of checking the ""isClosed"" flag

1\. For HA-cluster (enhanced cluster), you should at least use 4.4u2\. 4.4u2 has
fixes for important issues (including 6898355, 6926974, etc.) regarding broker
restart after takeover

2\. Set cluster failure detection property appropriate to you network and load.
Low values of imq.cluster.monitor.interval and imq.cluster.monitor.threshold
would increase the chance of false takeover

Thank you for the immediate response.

I installed 4.4u2 but no change in behaviour. The broker detects Split-Brain and
tries to shut down. But shut down doesn't work, the broker still receives messages.

I disabled all message bridges and retested again. Now the broker stops
immediately at Split-Brain-Situation and restarted again.

Is there an issue with shutdown when bridgemanager and bridges are enabled?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NzE1Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I am using version : 4.4 Update 2 Patch 1 (Build 1-c) that comes integrated with Glassfish.

I am setting up glassfish with REMOTE jms type in order to have all MB's running on a single blade and thus having the 'single point of failure' set into one place.

In order to do that I create some scripts to start the MB's on that blade.

Here is the command line that I use:

```
/bin/sh \
  /opt/sailfin/imq/bin/imqbrokerd \
    -javahome /opt/java \
    -Dimq.log.file.rolloverbytes=2000000 \
    -Dimq.jms.min_threads=10 \
    -Dimq.jms.max_threads=1000 \
    -Dimq.admin.max_threads=12 \
    -Dimq.hostname=primary_sc \
    -Dimq.cluster.hostname=primary_sc -Dimq.cluster.clusterid=traffic \
    -Dimq.cluster.masterbroker=mq://primary_sc:37677/ \
    -Dimq.cluster.brokerlist=mq://primary_sc:37677/ \
    -Dimq.cluster.nowaitForMasterBroker=true \
    -varhome /opt/sailfin/nodedata/nodeagents/primary_sc/MB_traffic_instance/imq \
    -startRmiRegistry \
    -rmiRegistryPort 37777 \
    -Dimq.imqcmd.user=admin \
    -passfile /home/mmas/imqpassword.dat \
    -save \
    -name MBtraffictrafficinstance \
    -port 37677 \
    -bgnd \
    -silent
```

What I found bizar is that even if I set '-Dimq.hostname=primary_sc' I do see in the log.txt file the following :

```
[26/Jan/2011:20:05:23 EST] JMX Connector Server jmxrmi started successfully with url service:jmx:rmi://SC-2-1/jndi/rmi://primary_sc:37777/primary_sc/37677/jmxrmi
```

The error to me is the ""SC-2-1"" definition ! I think it should be 'primary_sc' !

I think that the url should be : ""service:jmx:rmi://primary_SC/jndi/rmi://primary_sc:37777/primary_sc/37677/jmxrmi""

The blade has multiple interfaces && the hostname is 'SC-2-1' BUT it is refered as 'primary_sc' which is a 'movable' ip for HA at the service controller level.

Behaviour wise it seems that all ok but I am not sure since I do not have an app to test RMI.

BR,
Dan S.

@amykang2020 said:
The root cause of the issue is java/classes_nio bug 4715154 with memory mapped file deletion on Windows (MQ txn and txnack files by default uses memory mapped files). To workaround this, when the first time startup the MQ 4.5 broker from upgrading a 4.4u2x store on Windows when see broker log erorr ""Could not delete ...fs370\txn"" during broker startup, shutdown the broker and manually remove the files txn, txnack, convertingToTxnLogMode under MQ-VARHOME\instances\<broker-instance>\fs370\

This issue has been fixed in MQ 4.6 by renaming txn, txnack files to txn.deleted, txnack.deleted respectively if deletion fails. MQ administrator/user can remove txn.deleted and txnack.deleted files manually later.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NzMzNA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Depending on the value of this status code the user's program needs to take different action. To allow this, the possible status codes need to be made available as static constants in the JMX API.

The possible status codes are

400 BAD_REQUEST
405 NOT_ALLOWED
503 UNAVAILABLE
412 PRECONDITION_FAILED

The above constants should added to the utility class ChangeMasterBrokerResultInfo (though a different class could be used if this was thought preferable).

This will allow the user's program to distinguish between the above errors (which mean the cluster's config was unchanged) and any other errors (which means there was an unknown error requiring a cluster shutdown and manual configuration).

When this has been done, the Developer's Guide for JMX Clients needs to be updated to refer to these constants, and the appropriate behaviour.

@nigeldeakin said:
This has been implemented using a new ConnectionFactory property imqSocketConnectTimeout. This should be documented in the MQ admin guide as follows:

**Property**: imqSocketConnectTimeout

**Description**: This property defines the socket timeout, in milliseconds, used when a TCP connection is made to the broker. A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. The connection will then block until established or an error occurs. This property is used when connecting to the port mapper as well as when connecting to the required service.

**Default value**: 0

In previous versions of MQ the socket timeout could be configured by setting the system property imqSocketConnectTimeout, though this feature was undocumented and is unsupported. This feature remains available but continues to be undocumented and unsupported. For backwards compatibility, a value set using the system property imqSocketConnectTimeout will not be overridden if the property imqSocketConnectTimeout is set on the connection factory.

In addition, the MQ admin console imqadmin has been changed as shown in the attached screenshot. The Connection Factory Object properties dialog, Connection Handling tab, now has a new input field (at the bottom) for ""TCP Socket Connection Timeout (milliseconds)"". The online help needs to be updated to describe the new property.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NzQ1OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This means that in the event of a broker failure each connection to that broker can failover to any of the remaining brokers in the cluster, and that time is not wasted trying to failover to brokers that no longer exist.

For full and definitive detail of this feature please see the appropriate one-pager, which overrides the any detail included in this JIRA issue.

This change is needed to support the elasticity of managed MQ brokers in GlassFish 3.2.

The basic requirement here is to ensure that client connections to clustered brokers always hold an up-to-date list of the brokers in the cluster in order to ensure that in the event of connection failure the connection can failover to any of the remaining brokers in the cluster, and that time is not wasted trying to failover to brokers that no longer exist.

This requirement only applies in the following case:

*   Where the brokers in the cluster have their lifecycle managed by GlassFish. (Although similar behaviour would be desirable for
    non-managed broker clusters, this is not currently a requirement.)
*   Where the client connections are running in GlassFish and created using the JMSRA resource adapter. (Although similar behaviour would certainly be desirable for standalone client connections using the MQ client, this is outside the scope of this one-pager.)
*   For conventional clusters. (This behaviour is already available when using enhanced clusters, which are ""self-configuring"" and each client is automatically updated to hold an up-to-date list of the brokers in the cluster.)

In the standalone MQ client, the list of brokers in the cluster is set using the connection factory attribute <tt>imqAddressList</tt>. However where the client connection is created using the JMSRA resource adapter this property is set not by users but by JMSRA using the resource adapter property <tt>connectionURL</tt>, which may be overridden by setting the <tt>addressList</tt> property on an individual managed connection factory or activation spec.

Here is a summary of the existing behaviour in GlassFish 3.1 when using a conventional cluster:

*   When each GlassFish instance is started, the GlassFish JMS module sets the following properties on the JMSRA resource adapter. Note that these two properties are similar but not the same:
    *   <tt>connectionURL</tt> is set to a comma-separated list that defines the addressing scheme, host and port for each broker in the cluster. For example: <tt>mq://machine1:7676/jms,mq://machine2:7676/jms</tt>. The local broker should be the first in this list. JMSRA uses this property to set the <tt>imqAddressList</tt> of any connections made to that broker, unless it has been overridden by setting the <tt>addressList</tt> property on an individual managed connection factory or activation spec.
    *   <tt>clusterBrokerList</tt> is set to a comma-separated list of brokers in the cluster. For example: <tt>machine1:7676,machine2:7676</tt>. JMSRA uses this property to set the <tt>imq.cluster.brokerlist</tt> property of the managed local or embedded broker, both when it is first startedand when a local broker is restarted.
*   Whenever an instance is added to, or removed from, the GlassFish cluster, the GlassFish JMS module updates the <tt>clusterBrokerList</tt> of every resource adapter instance in the cluster with the new list of brokers. The RA uses this information only if it is managing a embedded or local broker, and uses it for the following purpose:
    *   It will save this information and use it to set <tt>imq.cluster.brokerlist</tt> when starting a managed (local or embedded) broker or when restarting a local broker.
    *   It uses a private protocol to send this information to the broker in order to update its <tt>imq.cluster.brokerlist</tt> property.

**Important:** Note that if cluster elasticity is required when the brokers are remote (which is explicitly out of scope for this one-pager), GlassFish must also set or update the <tt>clusterBrokerList</tt> in this case.

Although the above behaviour will ensure that the brokers have an up to date <tt>imq.cluster.brokerlist</tt> there is currently no mechanism
to ensure that existing and future connections have an up to date <tt>addressList</tt>. To achieve this the following additional behaviour is required:

*   Whenever an instance is added to, or removed from, the GlassFish cluster, the GlassFish JMS module updates the <tt>connectionURL</tt> of every resource adapter instance in the cluster to reflect the added or removed broker. The RA will use this information only if it is managing a embedded or local broker, and uses it for the following purpose:
    *   It will save this information and use it to set <tt>imqAddressListlist</tt> of any connections that are subsequently created unless it was overridden by setting the <tt>addressList</tt> property on an individual managed connection factory or activation spec.
    *   It uses it to update the <tt>imqAddressListlist</tt> of any existing connection factories.
    *   It uses a private protocol to send this information to the broker, which will then sent it to all its connected clients to update their <tt>imqAddressListlist</tt>,

**Important:** Note that if cluster elasticity is required when the brokers are remote (which is explicitly out of scope for this one-pager), GlassFish must also set or update the <tt>connectionURL</tt> in this case.
**TODO:** Define private protocol by which RA sends <tt>connectionURL</tt> to broker, and broker sends <tt>imqAddressListlist</tt> to existing connections.

This bug relates to the use of an embedded broker with direct mode client, as documented in the Message Queue ""Developers Guide for Java Clients"", chapter 6 ""Embedding a Message Queue Broker in a Java Client"".

If a queue has its maximum size defined using the destination property maxNumMsgs (for administratively-created queues) or the broker property imq.autocreate.destination.maxNumMsgs (for auto-created queues), then when that limit is reached, a TCP client receives a com.sun.messaging.jms.ResourceAllocationException (as documented in Table 18-1 ""Physical Destination Properties"" of the Message Queue Admin Guide). However a direct mode client does not receive any exception. The broker logs an error and rejects the new messages, but no exception is thrown to the client.

This is demonstrated using the attached test case. Before running it, set the broker args on line 81.

The test case as attached uses a TCP connection, and the exception thrown is

```
com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.util.BrokerException: [B4120]: Can not store message
14-10.175.12.175(e7:77:6f:2c:9a:97)-3715-1306435265343 on destination curlyQueue [Queue]. 
The destination message count limit (maxNumMsgs) of 100 has been reached.
Exception in thread ""main"" com.sun.messaging.jms.ResourceAllocationException: [C4096]: Destination is full 
and is rejecting new messages: curlyQueue user=guest, broker=localhost:7676(3711)
	at com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.ProtocolHandler.writeJMSMessage(ProtocolHandler.java:2001)
	at com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.WriteChannel.sendWithFlowControl(WriteChannel.java:179)
	at com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.WriteChannel.writeJMSMessage(WriteChannel.java:132)
	at com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.SessionImpl.writeJMSMessage(SessionImpl.java:795)

	at com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.QueueSenderImpl.send(QueueSenderImpl.java:128)
	at maxnummsgs.TestClient.main(TestClient.java:47)
```

Now uncomment line 35 (which sets the imqAddressList property to mq://localhost/direct) and repeat the test. No such exception is thrown.

imqdbmgr backup command is working but we are seeing the JMSBridgeStore class related exceptions when doing backup operation.

Steps to reproduce the problem:

1\. Start two brokers in HA cluster.
2\. Following exceptions are seen on the console when performing imqdbmgr backup -dir /tmp on one of the brokers in a HA cluster.

Amit in the performance group has gathered some collector/analyzer profiles for this (and some other) workloads. I've been looking at them, and although much of the code base has changed radically there are some similarities.

One example: During start-up of the EJB container, 3.1.1 spends 1.251 CPU seconds in com.sun.enterprise.connectors.ActiveRAFactory.createActiveResourceAdapter. In v2.1.1 we spend only 0.590 CPU seconds in the same method.

Drilling down into the call trees, it looks as if a major difference in com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.Broker.start. In v2.1.1 we spend 0.500 CPU seconds in that method, whereas in 3.1.1 we spend 0.991 CPU seconds.

Do you have data about the startup time difference between 3.0 and 3.1? Also, is this delay also observed on subsequent starts? One significant difference between 2 and 3 is delayed start of the broker service. Is that difference included in these tests? (i.e. is there something that will warm the broker connection?)

I'm told that, until the recent runs against 3.1.1, the EJB benchmark from which these numbers are drawn has not been run since v2.1.1.

This use case starts the app server and deploys the app. In 3.1.1 server start-up measured alone is significantly faster but the first deployment is significantly slower, precisely because of the deferred initialization that has moved work out of the start-up code path into various ""first-use"" code paths.

But whenever the broker is started, either during start-up as in v2.1.1 or at first-use during deployment as in 3.1.1, that work is getting done at some point and, if the traces I attached are relevant, it's taking longer in 3.1.1 than in 2.1.1\.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NzYyMQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Hi Tim,

Is it possible to ask the same profiling of broker startup to compare with or without following broker property setting ?
imq.persist.file.newTxnLog.enabled=false

This broker property can be set in GlassFish server domain.xml jms-service element start-args attribute for the server instance, like following
start-args=""-Dimq.persist.file.newTxnLog.enabled=false""

or set this property to the broker instance's config.properties file.

Currently, com.sun.messaging.jms.ra.ActivationSpec.setEndpointPoolResizeTimeout(int endpointPoolResizeTimeout) will throw an IllegalArgumentException if a value of 0 is supplied, meaning ""infinite timeout"".

JMSRA does not use this value. The current behaviour is that endpoints do not timeout, so in fact a value of 0 corresponds to the current behaviour but is not allowed.

This behaviour can be easily produced by configuring imqadmin to use the fscontext JNDI provider and creating, say, a connection factory with the JNDI name ""jms/myConnectionFactory"".

The object does appear to be created in JNDI (it is created in the .bindings file), and can be looked up using the JNDI API. However such objects are not displayed in imqadmin.

This may be specific to fscontext.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2NzcwNg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

In both cases, if a <tt>BrokerException</tt> is thrown during broker startup, this is simply logged without throwing an exception to JMSRA or the application using the embedded broker API.

The reason is that if <tt>Broker._start</tt> encounters a <tt>BrokerException</tt> (e.g. due to imq.brokerid not being set for a JDBC store), it catches the exception, logs it, and then returns a value of 1\.

Meanwhile, <tt>BrokerInstanceImpl.start()</tt> ignores this return value. This means that JMSRA or the application using the embedded broker API is left in an undefined state without JMSRA or the application knowing that something has gone wrong.

The fix is to change <tt>BrokerInstanceImpl.start()</tt> to check the return code from Broker.start() and throw a <tt>RuntimeException</tt> if it is non-zero.

This will then be caused by JMSRA (<tt>LifecycleManagedBroker.start()</tt> which will convert it into a <tt>ResourceAdapterInternalException</tt>.

The fix should be tested in both GlassFish and by an application using the embedded broker API.

The 2nd NPE is fixed in 5.0.1\. The NPE is triggered by following SQLException when storing the DMQ to the user defined MQDST41 table

This SQLException is caused by too small size of DESTINATION column - 1024\. Debugging shows that the Destination object to be stored, after serialization, has size=1153 (pos=2 mq.sys.dmq [Queue]). Increasing this column's size to 2048 works.

-------------------
Using a standalone MQ with JDBC persistence and non-clustered.
When a XA/Transactional message consumer and producers
are run with load, and the imq.txn.reapLimit default
it is seen that with the following MQ debug

-Dimq.debug.com.sun.messaging.jmq.util.timer.WakeupableTimer=true \
-Dimq.txn.reapInterval=15 \
-Dimq.cluster.debug.txn=true

that

1) The reaper thread is continuous running
2) But the rate of in transaction creation is just to much
that the MQTXN41<brokername> table and also the TransactionState
in the JDK histogram increases in count overtime

This means that the reaper prevent long run of high load
situation as it will not be stable according to M/M/1 queue
model.

Observation:
--------------
The table grows from the reapLimit 500 --> 30000 --> 48401
(in the matter of minutes) using a 50 concurrent thread
MT XA consumer.

Sample jmap -histo:live (note the MQ41TXN count is around 51000
too).

Note 1: Problem is that if the broker crash it takes also some time to
start to process these transaction entries and it may not be
able to clear them when load continues (compounding issues) ***

Note 2: One restarting and no load, the clearing of the MQ41TXN table
is not that quick as it is seen in one second it takes 1000 or
so rows.

Testcase
----------
0\. Setup a single broker JDBC backed MQ
1\. Refer: 6961586 for the MQ XA stress for the testcase
2\. Query the MQ41TXN<brokername> occassionally to see
growth
3\. Run jmap -histo:live and observe growth.
#### Environment
Unix, MQ44u2p0x, Single standalone MQ with JDBC persistence

Generally, it would probably be best to have the JMS service thread that's done with the transaction especially those with
commit state.Say if the thing is to retain imqcmd list txn and the reapLimit feature, i suppose, the logic is that for most
of the txnReaper.addXXXTransaction should be synchronous
ie:

*   It still add the TID to the translist but
*   It probably should also do check like
    if translist.SIZE > REAPLIMIT
    remove top translist (not serviced by Reaper)
    so logic in reaper that remove 1 entry
    (earliest txn)

Now one can have both the background reaper (still needed

*   since if there is no load who's going to cleanup old txn).
    and some synchronous cleanup by working jms thread
    to avoid the slow bottleneck.

Obviously the devil is in the details","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2Nzg2MA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Steps to verify the bug:

1\. Start the broker with JDBC store.
2\. Send transacted messages.
3\. Run the imqcmd dump trans -debug command multiple times and check the committedCount in the dumpOutput file.
4\. The value should not vary in large numbers.

Example 7-1 Wildcard Publisher and Example 7-2 Wildcard Subscriber suggests that the wildcard can be used in the JNDI name, which is incorrect. The wildcard can only be used in the topic name.

The Message Queue 4.5 Developer's Guide for Java Clients contains the following note on page 41 and again on page 42.

> Note - For topic destinations, a symbolic lookup name that includes wildcard characters can be
> used as the lookup string. See ""Supported TopicDestinationNames"" in OpenMessage
> Queue 4.5 Administration Guide.

This contains the same error. When looking up a topic from JNDI, the lookup string cannot include wildcard characters.

Both documents need to be clarified to explain that when wildcards are used, it is the topic name that contains the wildcard character, not the JNDI name.

It has worked fine with OMQ 4.3 and 4.4u1 for well over a year. A developer recently installed 4.5.1 on his workstation and attempted to run the application, and received the Windows error dialog saying that MSVCR90.DLL could not be found. Both 4.3 and 4.4u1 are built against the same DLL and find it just fine, as does another 3rd party library that the application also uses. Nothing else about the system or application has changed: system PATH correctly points to the proper 4.5.1 mq\lib and nss\lib folders, the latest vcredist_x86.exe has been installed and reinstalled multiple times, etc. We have tried on 3 different Windows 7 developer workstations and a Windows 2003 server, all of which work fine with OMQ 4.3/4.4u1\. When I change the PATH to point from 4.5.1 libs to 4.4u1 libs, the app works again.

Further, when I point Dependency Walker to the 4.5.1 MQCRT1.DLL, it also complains that it cannot find MSVCR90.DLL. However when I open up MQCRT1.DLL from 4.4 and 4.3, it resolves the same DLL just fine. This comparison should be easily reproducible in your own tests.

Since MSVCR90.DLL is the C runtime from VS 2008, and we've installed the latest SP1 copy of vcredist_x86.exe which is the official and recommended method for redistributing that particular runtime library, I have to assume that the 4.5.1 C API is broken. Perhaps it was been built incorrectly, or against some strange version of MSVCR90.DLL that isn't widely available, or with a corrupted manifest that is pointing to a non-existent version of MSVCR90.DLL. Thankfully VS 2010 eliminates the manifest requirements and allows you to just drop MSVC runtime DLLs in application folders like the old days, but unfortunately VS 2008 requires the manifest and SxS registry approach (taking us from DLL Hell to Manifest Hell). It would be nice if OMQ could be built against VS 2010, or better yet, statically linked with the VS 2010 C runtime so as to eliminate dependance on external runtime libs.

As a temporary workaround, I've discovered that if I replace the 4.5.1 MQCRT1.DLL with the one from 4.4u1, it works and seems to successfully work against a running 4.5.1 broker. Not sure if this is recommended or supported though.

Jill,

I'm certainly puzzled by your successful test. Could it be that this other system already had the same odd version of MSVCR90.DLL that MQCRT1.DLL is looking for? Could it be a later build of 4.5 that has corrected the issue? I'm testing with 4.5.1.

I have a 100% reproduction rate across every system that I've tried. Three different physical machines, a Windows 7 VM, and a Windows Server VM. Every single one results in the exact same issue, i.e. MQCRT1.DLL from 4.5 cannot resolve its dependency on MSVCR90.DLL. But MSVCR90.DLL exists and everything else that depends on it, including 4.4, finds it just fine.

Yes, the correct nss\lib folder is in my PATH. I don't keep Mozilla stuff in my PATH, so it wouldn't be finding its DLLs. I also have a Windows port of the **which** command, which searches the system PATH for the first occurrence of a specified file, and it always returns the DLLs from the 4.5 nss\lib folder when I'm testing with 4.5\. But just to be sure, I moved 4.5's nss\lib to the very front of my PATH. Same result.

Here are a couple of screenshots from Dependency Walker that illustrate the issue.

In this screenshot, I have loaded 4.4's MQCRT1.DLL into Dependency Walker with 4.4 paths configured in my PATH. You can see that the first dependency is MSVCR90.DLL which is resolved to the Windows SxS folder as would be expected on Windows 7\. You can also see that all NSS libs are correctly referenced in the 4.4 folders.

![](http://morrisonline.us/screenshots/omqcapi_4.4_depends.png)

Now, here's a screenshot with 4.5's MQCRT1.DLL loaded in Dependency Walker after setting my PATH to point to 4.5 libs. Now you see that MSVCR90.DLL is **not** resolved (hence the yellow question mark), but all the NSS libs are correctly located.

![](http://morrisonline.us/screenshots/omqcapi_4.5_depends.png)

This behavior is reproducible across all systems that I've tried, as I mention. My application fails to find MSVCR90.DLL just like Dependency Walker does, despite the fact that file exists (as evidenced by the 4.4 screenshot).

Are there **any** users who are successfully using the MQCRT1.DLL from 4.5.1?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2ODAxMg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The vcredist_x86 installer should be located in the MSVC 2008 redistributable folder (I don't remember the exact path, I don't have 2008 installed anymore and my 2010 doesn't seem to include the equivalent 10.0 version, although it's available for download). You can also download the 2008 runtime installer directly from Microsoft here:

We tried both versions and neither worked. I'm not convinced it's a compatibility issue per se – at least we've never seen the same issue with the various other things that depend on the same MSVCR90.DLL.

So strange that you're not seeing this, but perhaps it **is** an issue with the deployment package?

We downloaded and installed this one: [http://download.java.net/mq/open-mq/4.5.1/latest/openmq4_5_1-installer-WINNT.zip](http://download.java.net/mq/open-mq/4.5.1/latest/openmq4_5_1-installer-WINNT.zip)

Different developers on different workstations downloaded it separately and had the same problem, so it's not a case of sharing a single corrupted download (besides the ZIP archive would've complained about corruption anyway). On a whim, just now I also downloaded the non-installer ZIP archive from the 4.5.1 download page, unzipped it, and compared its MQCRT1.DLL with the one from the installer. Not surprisingly, they were binary identical, and Dependency Walker choked on it as well. So if it is a corrupted version in the package, it's corrupted the same in both packages.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2ODAxNg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

if MQ 4.5 works for you. Thanks again.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2ODAxNw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I just tried the DLL from the 4.5.b29-fcs release (latest 4.5.0 build I found) and while it is a different size (thus a different build) it failed the same way. So I figured I'd try the earliest build of 4.5 I could find, which happened to be b03\. It worked! So obviously the ""break"" happened somewhere between b03 and b29\. I'm going to take a binary search approach and see if I can't quickly find where things changed...

EDIT: Okay, I've zeroed in on where the break happened: 4.5b18\. b17 and prior resolve MSVCR90.DLL correctly, while every build after b17 fails. So something different **must** have happened in the b18 build that has carried forward.

I'm still completely perplexed as to why you're not seeing this, as it's so blatant to me in my tests – I don't even have to try very hard, it fails 100% of the time on every machine. Are we comparing the same way? Are you using Dependency Walker?

EDIT x2: I've discovered one telling difference between <=b17 and >=b18 builds of MQCRT1.DLL that could be related. Running MS's dumpbin with the /dependents switch on a variety of these builds show that with b17 and prior (including 4.4) that work, a **<tt>.rsrc</tt>** (Resource) section is included. It's missing from b18 and every build after that doesn't work.

Coincidence??

Hello.
Can you please let me know when this will be fixed in the client?
Also is there any workaround you can suggest so that the code will come out of a situation like this even if it occurs? Its strange because we don't see any socket connection on the server side. so there is nothing we can ""kill"" so that the code comes out of this wait.

Hi Nigel,

We saw this problem couple of times and both cases were a result of a n/w outage. Around 5% of the client thread to cluster got stuck at this point show above in the logs.
I have tried various options to reproduce this but with no success. OS is linux. we do not see any incoming connections or sockets on the jms side so the only way out of this is to restart the clients.
We had another occurrence of this very long time back reported earlier.

As far as I figured out, the problem here is that the column <tt>SEQ</tt> is handled case sensitively by the JDBC driver or respectively the PostgreSQL.
On table creation all column names are transformed into the lower case variant. But when inserting the change record, the upper case variant of <tt>SEQ</tt> is used.

As a dirty work around I added a further column named <tt>SEQ</tt> - completely upper-case - to the table having the same values as the lower case variant.
And this seems to work.

```
alter table MQSHARECC45Cgdlite1_MQ add column ""SEQ"" bigint;
update MQSHARECC45Cgdlite1_MQ set ""SEQ"" = seq;
alter table MQSHARECC45Cgdlite1_MQ alter ""SEQ"" set not null;

begin
   if TG_OP = 'INSERT' or TG_OP = 'UPDATE' then
      NEW.""SEQ"" = NEW.seq;

      return NEW;
   end if;

   return OLD;
end
$$

Didn't find any downloadable PostgreSQL 8.1.3 anymore, but tried it instead with PostgreSQL 8.3.17.
With that version the problem doesn't seems to appear. As far as I can see, the difference must be that
<tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.persist.jdbc.comm.CommDBManager.supportsGetGeneratedKey()</tt> must be <tt>true</tt>
with PostgreSQL 9.1 but <tt>false</tt> with the old version.

The SQL statements submitted with the old PostgeSQL version (8.3.17), were:

```
INSERT INTO MQSHARECC45Cmedusa ( UUID, RECORD, TYPE, CREATED_TS) VALUES ( $1, $2, $3, $4 )
SELECT SEQ FROM MQSHARECC45Cmedusa WHERE UUID = $1
```

with the new version the following statement was submitted instead

```
INSERT INTO MQSHARECC45Cgdlite1_MQ ( UUID, RECORD, TYPE, CREATED_TS) VALUES ( $1, $2, $3, $4 ) RETURNING ""SE
Q""
```

Which seems to match with the following block in <tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.persist.jdbc.sharecc.ShareConfigRecordDAOImpl#insert</tt>

```

The issue is reproduced with PostgreSQL, 9.1.2, PostgreSQL 9.1 JDBC3 (build 901). The following is the stacktrace of the broker exception on processing 'imqcmd create dst'.

The cause of the problem is PostgreSQL server 9.1.2 regression that the JDBC API retrieving generated key by column names
conn.prepareStatement( sql, new String[]

{SEQ_COLUMN}

)

stops working in PostgreSQL 9.1.2 but works in PostgreSQL 8.1.3\. Using the alternative JDBC API conn.prepareStatement( sql, Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS ) worked around the problem.

if (o instanceof Ordered && ((Ordered)o).getOrder() == 0 ) {
long id = (long)pri << 28;
id += queuePosition;
queuePosition ++;
((Ordered)o).setOrder(id);
}

And use the reverse way to decode priority from ID:

pri = (int)((long)ordernum >> 28);

queuePosition is a internal 32-bit integer counter which is used in NFLPriorityFifoSet and get incremented whenever an object is enqueued.
When the enqueue count of a NFLPriorityFifoSet, say a queue, is over then 268435455 (the maximum number of a unsigned 28 bit integer), then the queuePosition will overflow to the 4bits used by the priority field.

When a client consumer is closing, the previous unacked messages dispatched to it will be put back to the queue.
The priority array's size of a queue is 11, which means ""pri"" index decoded from (int)((long)ordernum >> 28) cannot exceed 10
When it exceeds, it will cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at:

// find the right place and add in front
ientry = priorities[pri];

And then the pre-dispatched messages will be stuck in Pending for ACK state, which cannot be consumed at all. The only way to remove them is to purge the destination.

The counter should use long instead of int to solve this issue because using long as a counter is very very unlikely for overflow to happen.
Also, the 28bit shifting should be changed to 60bit in a 64-bit long, which still leave the most significant 4 bits for the priority value.

============================================
Below is the exception log from the broker (as you can see, the overflow of queuePosition caused the priority changed to 13, which does not exist) :

The test persist/api/file creates its own broker instance with name ""persistapi.file"". So 1) if any other tests restart a broker it would not be the instance ""persistapi.file""; 2) the test persist/api/file does not affect the default broker (the one running on port 7676) that other tests can restart; 3) The broker logging output shown in Description can only come from test persist/api/file

The persist/api/file is a persist store internal API ('white box') test. The test

1\. Takes ~7.5min to run (on a Solaris 8x3325 MHz system)
2\. The ERROR [B3007] are expected by the test. For example, some sub-tests of the test remove messages from a destination, then verify attempting to retrieve or remove the same message again will get exception as expected - e.g. test outputs like following can be found in .eout file

== Store.getInterestState:test 5:got BrokerException; test passed

----------------

According to Mathi, some of Mathi's comments above came from his early stage of testing MQ 5.0 Grizzly connection service which was caused by a different issue that has been fixed (see internal jira JMS-216).

Change this issue to test and close. The putback.list (part of nightly.list) has been running on Windows for each nightly/milestone build. Mathi, please file a separate issue if you see problem other than test persist/api/file when running putback.list on your Windows system","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2ODIxMA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

@nigeldeakin said:
A brief investigation suggests that when the message is sent in the second transaction, the packet that is sent contains the transactionID from the first transaction. Since this transaction was committed this causes the broker to return an ""unknown transaction"" error.

The cause seems to be that when a message is sent, the transactionid is copied from the DirectSession to the Packet being sent. However this transactionid is not re-initialised when the second transaction is started.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2ODI3Mw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The Gf LOCAL MQ brokers are clustered, however. The queue senders in our Enterprise Application which is deployed on both Gf app servers may send out up to 100+ small (1Kb) messages in a second (although not all the time). The messages seem to be picked up by either of the queue listeners. After a few hours (4+) we usually see the messages (up to thousands) are stuck under UnAck column of the 'imqcmd query dst' command output from either of the MQ brokers.

Attachment is the stack trace from JConsole of the 'hang' broker. As you can see, MessageBusCallbackDispatcher and Checkpoint runner threads are locking each other out while about 1000+ other threads (Thread-jms[XXX]) are waiting on Checkpointer runner thread.

Reclassifiying as a MQ client bug.

The tests that fail are not JMS 1.1 TCK tests but new tests planned for a future version of JMS. So this isn't currently a TCK failure.

At first glance this looks like a bug in the MQ client: the javadoc for the QueueRequestor constructor mentioned above state that it should throw a InvalidDestinationException - ""if an invalid queue is specified."" A value of null is invalid here, so a InvalidDestinationException should be thrown.

However the code to implement QueueRequestor and TopicRequestor is actually delivered with the JMS spec itself. So this is not a bug in MQ itself but is a bug in the standard implementation shipped with JMS.

Closing this as not a bug,

This is the same as [http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-18436](http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-18436)

The JMS_SUN_COMPRESS checking is not done in the Direct

hence is not on the common machinery. ie: DirectPacket
have the Z_FLAG is true...

Since jmsclient MessageImpl is the one doing the

Hello Nigel,

as we asked for a correction per Orace SR 3-5395017701:

Would it be possible to solve this for the next minor MQ release being compatible with GF 3.1.2?

My idea is to replace the MQ version (which one??) released as part of GF 3.1.2 with the updated one.

Hello Nigel,

yes, we filed SR 3-5395017701 : Unable to send compressed JMS message from client to Glassfish to request a solution
for this issue. Do you think it will be get part of the next MQ 4.5.3 release. I am not sure about the schedules since even
MQ 4.5.2 is not complete according to the JIRA repository.

Are there any planning pages with up-to-date infos?

------------------
Although there is now a better log rotation in MQ5.0 compared
to MQ4.x, there is still not possible to issue a manual log rotation

Please consider adding:
--------------------------
a) Adding a JMX log rotation and log reopen function

b) Do consider if imqcmd can have such a function for cases
that does not go thru JMX.

—
PS:
—
Note as a whole the logging feature on MQ5.x for better management
should keep mind the following (deficiencies in MQ4.x)

*   Log rotate with timestamps suffix (log.txt_<timestamp>)
*   Log rotation with keeping X number of copies
*   Able to force a log rotation or log reopen (the latter is good
    for manual log management using logrotate/logadm)
*   JMS Client-side libs should have more fine grain log for specific
    function to control. (Similar if possible for broker end)
    [If this is integrated to JULI, and having JMX, it may be controllable
    dynamically]

*   MQ5.0

A potential workaround is to simply shutdown any broker that you wish to remove from the cluster, using

imqcmd shutdown bkr

All data in an enhanced availability cluster will be migrated to remaining nodes of the cluster. Periodic warnings in the logs, such as:

If you try to use message.setObjectProperty(""foo"",null) or setStringProperty(""bar"",null) to set a message property to null you will get a MessageFormatException.

However section 3.12 of the JMS 1.1 specification states ""The JMS message interfaces provide write/set methods for setting object values in a message body and message properties. All of these methods must be implemented to copy their input objects into the message. The value of an input object is allowed to be null and will return null when accessed.""

This applies to both the normal MQ client as well as a JMSRA client.

The ([javadoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/jms/Session.html#createConsumer%28javax.jms.Destination,%20java.lang.String,%20boolean%29) ) documents the <tt>messageSelector</tt> parameter as follows:

> A value of null or an empty string indicates that there is no message selector for the message consumer.

A value of null acts as if there is no message selector. However a value of <tt>""""</tt> prevents messages being added to the subscription.

Test case here: this fails if messageSelector is set to <tt>""""</tt>. However it passes if it is set to <tt>null</tt>.

```

I've reviewed the code (for Java SE client, JMSRA direct mode and JMSRA TCP mode), and confirmed that this is the case. I also added some new tests to make sure. (TestJMSContext.doTestCreateMessage).

In the course of reviewing the code I spotted some dead code that needed to be tidied up. Need to change the constructor for DirectPacket and its subclasses so that the JMSService is no longer passed in as a parameter. Since we are in a code freeze state I will defer this for 5.0.1\.

Destinations are loaded on demand. When destination is not loaded the count in 'imqcmd list dst' output reflects the message count in persist store - non-processed by the broker. In this test case there is no open transaction, no active consumer or producer on the destination after the broker restarts, the count 1 reflects that failed message removal from persist store.

A '-load' option is added to 'imqcmd list dst'. When 'imqcmd list dst -load' is requested, the broker will load the destination first if not loaded, then get the message count (see imqcmd -h)

B3044 can be INFO and WARNING. ,glassfishrobot,6104758,glassfishrobot,,CLOSED,2012-08-30T07:34:43Z,2017-05-09T17:42:02Z,"I checked the version 4.5 source code and I found the error code B3044 is defined as WARNING for the most, but sometimes defined as INFO.

In BrokerResources.java, B3044 is defined as E_INTERNAL_ERROR.

mq\src\share\java\com\sun\messaging\jmq\jmsserver\resources\BrokerResources.java:
final public static String E_INTERNAL_ERROR = ""B3044"";

If you search all source code using ""grep E_INTERNAL_ERROR"", most of them are defined as WARNING. However, sometimes E_INTERNAL_ERROR is defined as INFO. For example, in the following files, E_INTERNAL_ERROR is output as INFO.

mq\src\share\java\com\sun\messaging\jmq\jmsserver\core\Destination.java
logger.log(Logger.INFO, BrokerResources.E_INTERNAL_ERROR, ex);
mq\src\share\java\com\sun\messaging\jmq\jmsserver\cluster\ha\HAClusterManagerImpl.java
logger.logStack(logger.INFO, BrokerResources.E_INTERNAL_ERROR, ex);

The error level is inconsistent for the B3044\.
Could you please change all of the B3044 to WARNING?

1\. start a broker with JDBC store
2\. send a message to a queue
3\. apply fault injection in JDBC store on removing transaction ack to throw a non-retriable exception; then unset fault
4\. start a XA receiver that uses MQ's XAResourceImpl for XAResource (e.g. JMSJCA, genericRA), do following in a loop:
start a XA transaction
receive the message from the queue in #2
end the XA transaction
rollback XA transaction <-- will trigger the fault in #3

The XA receiver client will get following exception on each loop iteration in #4

The issue can be reproduced with one of the followings:

(A) A user accidentally deletes accesscontorl.properties when editing it.
1.Delete accesscontrol.properties.
2.From the command prompt, enter imqbrokerd to start broker.
3.Try for example, imqcmd list dst. This fails with authentication error.
(Note: On step 1, if you delete the folder containing the accesscontrol.properties, that is glassfish\domains\domain1\imq\instances\imqbroker\etc, the accesscontrol.properties is re-created automatically while the imqbrokerd is being started.)

(B) A user specifies an incorrect filename for the imq.accesscontrol.file.filename option.
1.Start imqbrokded with default setting, and then shutdown.
2.Specify an incorrect filename for the imq.accesscontrol.file.filename option.
imqbrokerd -Dimq.accesscontrol.file.filename=incorrect filename
3.Try for example, imqcmd list dst. This fails with authentication error.

(Note: If you specify an incorrect filename for a new instance which has not been used before, imqbrokerd does not start. )

(C) A user specifies an incorrect filename for the imq.user_repository.file.filename option.
1.Start imqbrokded with default setting, and then shutdown.
2.Specify an incorrect filename for the imq.user_repository.file.filename option.

1\. In all 3 cases, it is expected that imqcmd gets authentication error. All 3 cases of authentication failure are due to mis-configuration for which the broker logs the reason.

2\. The accesscontrol file and user_repository file can be configured per service name or per authentication type. These files are accessed and loaded by broker lazily on demand depending on at runtime whether a client connects to a service or use an authentication type. To validate existence of all these files at broke startup may, on the other hand, be at the cost of ease-of-use if a service is not going to be used.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTE3Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

```

B:When -1 is specified for timeToLive send(Message message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive)of MessageProducer class, the message goes to the dead queue (mq.sys.dmq).

1.Execute the program.
2.The program completes.
3.Check the queue. imqcmd list dst. You will find the count for the mq.sys.dmq increased.

I expect the same error message as A is displayed in this case.

Attached is the sample program.

1.Create a connection factory with minimum pool 1 and idle time out 10\.

```
asadmin create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.ConnectionFactory jms/CF
asadmin set resources.connector-connection-pool.jms/CF.steady-pool-size=1
asadmin set resources.connector-connection-pool.jms/CF.idle-timeout-in-seconds=10
```

2.Execute ConnectionFactory.createConnection() 10 times using the Connection Factory created in step 1\.

```
Connection connection[] = new Connection[10];
InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext() ;
ConnectionFactory cf = ( ConnectionFactory ) initialContext.lookup(""jms/CF"") ;
for(int i=0;i<10; i++) {
     connection[i] = cf.createConnection();
}
```

3.Execute ""imqcmd query svc -n jms"" and confirm the ""Current Number of Allocated Threads"" is larger than ""Min Number of Threads"".

*   Current Number of Allocated Thread: 22
*   Current Number of Connections: 10
*   Min Number of Threads: 10 (default)

4.In the JMS application used in step. 2, execute Connection.close() 5 times. This closes 5 connections.

```
for(int i=0;i<5; i++) {
    connection[i].close();
}
```

5.After 10 minutes, execute ""imqcmd query svc -n jms"" to check the following values.

*   Current Number of Allocated Thread: 20
*   Current Number of Connections: 5
*   Min Number of Threads: 10 (default)

Problem:
The Current Number of Allocated Thread does not decrease as expected.

Expected:
Current Number of Allocated Thread decreases and becomes one of the followings:

*   The Current Number of Allocated Thread is the same number as the Min Number of Threads.
*   The Current Number of Allocated Thread is the same as twice the value of Current Number of Allocated Thread.

6.Terminate the JMS application mentioned in step 2\.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/215/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The attached JMS client does the followings:
1\. Lookup a ConnectionFactory without ClientID
2\. Create a Connection out of the ConnectionFactory of step 1.
3\. Create a Session out of the Connection created in step 2\.
4\. Close the Connection created in step 2\.
5\. Create a Connection again out of ConnectionFactory of step 1\.
6\. SetClientID to the Connection created in step 5\.

The issue is when Step 6 is executed, following Exception ocurrs.
javax.jms.IllegalStateException: [C4054]: Cannot set client ID, invalid state.

The following steps reproduces the issue:
1\. Create a new Connection Factory (If you are using Windows, you can run attached setup.bat instead.)
asadmin create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.ConnectionFactory jms/ConnectionFactory001

2\. Run the test program. (If you are using Windows, you can run attached run.bat instead.)
appclient -client dest\clientiderror.jar

3\. When the test program is executed, the following Exception is displayed.
javax.jms.IllegalStateException: [C4054]: Cannot set client ID, invalid state.

However, when the Step 2, 3, 4 (Line 45 to 52 in JMSProducer.java) are commented out, the Exception does not occur.
Follow the steps below to re-create the clientiderror.jar and test this.
1\. Edit the JMSProducer.java
2\. Open command prompt and type ant. clientiderror.jar is created under the folder called dest.
3\. appclient -client dest\clientiderror.jar
4\. The program completes without exception.

```

The error message means either (1) clientID has been administratively configured on the connection factory, or (2) the call to setClientID is not the first action on the connection. Clearly neither is the case here, so this looks like a bug.

setClientID is allowed in the application client, but in the server (the web or EJB container) it throws an exception. This test case goes through that check just fine, so we can eliminate the possibility that the client mistakenly thinks that it's running in the server.

I modified the test case slightly to confirm that the problem is caused by the code that creates a different connection beforehand:

```
public void run( int round )
		throws NamingException, JMSException
	{
		InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext( ) ;
		ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = ( ConnectionFactory )initialContext.lookup( connectionFactoryName ) ;
		Connection connection1 = connectionFactory.createConnection( ) ;
		try {
			// if you comment out the next line the test passes
			Session session1 = connection1.createSession( false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ) ;
		} finally {
			connection1.close( ) ;
		}

		for( int i = 0 ; i < round ; i++ ) {
			System.out.println( ""[JMSProducer] round "" + ( i + 1 ) + "" *****START*****"" ) ;
			Connection connection2 = connectionFactory.createConnection( ) ;
			try {
				// Exception here.
				connection2.setClientID( clientID ) ;
				Session session2 = connection2.createSession( false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ) ;
			} finally {
				connection2.close( ) ;
			}
			System.out.println( ""[JMSProducer] round "" + ( i + 1 ) + "" ***** END *****"" ) ;
		}
	}
```

The first connection is created, a session is created (so that calling setClientiD becomes invalid), and the connection is then closed so that it returns to the pool.

When the second connection is created it looks as if this is reusing the first connection, but that connection hasn't been reset correctly. To confirm this, if you leave the second connection open when you create the second connection, the test passes.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTI1Ng==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

We are running on centos5.6

We have a configuration that consists of 4 brokers in a traditional non-HA cluster. We have one broker in los angeles, one in munich germany, one in singapore, and one in virginia. There is at least 130ms latency between brokers and depending on which brokers you are looking at can be up to 200ms. We have seen on several occasions where the brokers go ""split brained"". essentially, one broker will see 500 messages on a topic and all are unread, but another broker will think all subscribed clients have read the 500 messages already and shows a message counter of zero. So one broker is waiting for the other to read messages and the other broker thinks it has read them all already. This will remain ""stuck"" until we stop the server, remove the fs370 directories on all brokers (to make them forget all state and message data) and restart them.

The cluster config is as follows:

I'm referring to the output of the ""imqcmd list dst"" command:

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Name           Type    State      Producers        Consumers  Msgs

```

The ""count"" would say the max for the destination, in this case 500, and the ""remote"" would say ""500"", presumably meaning that there are 500 messages on the topic and all of them are on some broker other than the one i ran the command on. At the same time, other brokers would report all zeroes.

> The problem as described in the Description appears to be message 'stopped' delivery. Please provide the following information,

Yes, until the destination would max out. At that point, new messages would have to wait until the existing messages timed out. after that, I'm not sure what happens. I am not sure which clients might be able to read the new messages on the destination, if the ""remote"" clients are reading, it is too slow for our application to actually be able to use the data. However, the next time this happens, we will check the read rate on the clients to see if they are receiving messages or not.

> Your application running environment

We are using 1.6.0_14 (with a few patches for security) and tomcat tomcat-6.0.26 on centos linux 5.6\.

> How your application uses JMS ?

It is used for interprocess communication. Typically messages are small, non-transactional, and have a short expiration time (60 seconds).

> 'imqcmd list dst', 'imqcmd query dst' outputs when the problem occurs
> All broker logs in the cluster

We'll capture this the next time it occurs.

> A test case that reproduces the problem

So far, it seems random. However, we have recently changed our topology from a 2 location to a 4 location cluster. When we only had lax and muc, the problem was noticeably less frequent. Our current theory is that latency in the communications has made the issue more likely to happen.

From #186, it lists consumer states while the issue is happening. Is there an easy way to determine these states? It mentions a property to log dead messages, but we have the dead message queue turned off (via ""imq.autocreate.destination.useDMQ=false"").

Yes, 'Remote' count are messages coming from other broker(s) for the consumer - which is 'remote consumer' to other brokers. What does the 'UnAck' column show ? If the message count on other brokers 0, it appears that all messages had been expired. Next time, please get all brokers 'imqcmd list dst' outputs

Are the consumers durable subscriptions ? If yes, please get 'imqcmd list dur' outputs on all brokers also

Are messages PERSISTENT messages ? What is acknowledgement mode that the consumers use ? What are the connection factory property settings for the consumer connections ?

imq.autocreate.destination.useDMQ is mentioned in #186 only for seeing message expiration log messages.

The consumer states in a broker, as shown in #186, can be obtained by imqcmd dump bkr -o file=<filename-to-dump-to> -debug","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTI4Nw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Thanks for the logs and imqcmd outputs.

1\. The combination of values in 'Count', 'Remote' and 'UnAck', except #2 (below), are expected with NO_ACK mode under normal operation. Messages expired, at different stages of the message life cycle, waiting for being reapped by periodic reaper thread

2\. The non-zero 'Count' and 'Remote' in destination amg.control on jms2.lax.adconion.com and zero count on other brokers, are due to broker link failure between jms2.lax.adconion.com and other brokers which caused marking remote expired message ACK failure, like the following exceptions (below) shown in jms2.lax broker logs. The counts on jms2.lax were not cleaned up because of that, it does not affect broker function.

3\. There appeared to be network problem occurred during the below exceptions timeframe - see below ""Establish .."", ""Closed cluster .."" broker log messages in jms10.sin for broker link to jms2.lax

4\. I can see #3 could be the reason for you to restart the brokers if network problem resulted half-open inter-broker socket connections (see #223). What's the reason that you had to clean up the broker's persist store ?

5\. The default remote ack reply is 180sec, it can be configured by setting broker property imq.cluster.acktimeout (in seconds)

> 2\. The non-zero 'Count' and 'Remote' in destination amg.control on jms2.lax.adconion.com and zero count on other brokers, are due to broker link failure between jms2.lax.adconion.com and other brokers which caused marking remote expired message ACK failure, like the following exceptions (below) shown in jms2.lax broker logs. The counts on jms2.lax were not cleaned up because of that, it does not affect broker function.

Does this mean jms2.lax was temporarily (longer than 180 seconds apparently) isolated from all other brokers? We registered no network failures, although I have added additional monitoring to our brokers specifically to attempt to detect an issue such as this in the future. It just seems a little unlikely...

> 3\. There appeared to be network problem occurred during the below exceptions timeframe - see below ""Establish .."", ""Closed cluster .."" broker log messages in jms10.sin for broker link to jms2.lax

hm, I see these on other brokers as well, different time stamps, so this apparently is a long running issue for us. 180 seconds though, wow that's a long time... how is that determined? is a jms message sent through the cluster in a similar manner as other messages? Is there any other traffic in that communication path that might slow down the send/receive rate?

> 4\. I can see #3 could be the reason for you to restart the brokers if network problem resulted half-open inter-broker socket connections (see #223). What's the reason that you had to clean up the broker's persist store ?

We have a policy that in any jms issue, especially ones requiring a restart, we clear the persistent store to ensure that we are starting up in a known state. When the cluster goes down, we are losing money till it is fixed, so we don't have time to guess or assume. ![](https://java.net/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif)

> 5\. The default remote ack reply is 180sec, it can be configured by setting broker property imq.cluster.acktimeout (in seconds)

What's the downside of setting it to something like 10 minutes?","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTI5Ng==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

No, does not look like based on the logs, if assuming the problem timeframe was on 20/Oct/2012 (around what time ?). The last lose of links to jms2.lax shown in the logs appear to be admin initiated shutdown/restart.

>180 seconds ... how is that determined?
It's the default setting.

>is a jms message sent through the cluster in a similar manner as other messages? Is there any other traffic in that communication path that might slow down the send/receive rate?
Yes and no - almost all packets are put on the link in the same manner and different type of packets may get processed on different processing path when it arrives the other end. In your case, since no transaction, if consumers/destinations are not frequently closed/re-created (true ?), majority of the traffic are JMS messages and acks.

>What's the downside of setting it to something like 10 minutes?
It will block the remote ack caller thread max. for that long time waiting for ack reply if it's synchronous ack. Since it appears that the destination shown in the stacktrace is configured with REMOVE_OLDEST, then your publisher application could be blocked for that long time, if it does happen, if the new message produced caused an old remote expired message to be removed.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTI5OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

*   According to our application performance, it started around 2:50GMT and resolved after our restart around 4:00GMT on Oct 24
*   All systems are synced with the ntp daemon and are accurate.
*   I think consumers shouldn't be recreated unless the app is restarted or some other disconnect happens. Producers only connect when they need to produce something.
*   Everything uses NO_ACK mode

> if consumers/destinations are not frequently closed/re-created (true ?)

True, they are statically defined on broker start up via a bash script and clients are restricted such that they cannot create destinations themselves.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTMwMg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I am attaching a screenshot showing a Latency/Loss network graph (strafeping in opennms) to jms10.sin from our lax colo. The most recent spike does correlate with some ""wobblies"" in our application, so I think we found the root of our problem. I can also see that the previous window on this graph lasted from ~11:35GMT to ~11:55GMT, which is WAY longer than the default 180 second timeout and probably way longer than we'd ever want to set it to.

jms10.sin is in AWS's singapore ec2 region.

Hurricane Sandy caused some pretty nasty packet loss between our colos and triggered this issue again. It sounds like there are some kind of cluster control messages between brokers that are getting lost, causing a cluster disconnect. Why does the cluster not try to reconnect in our case? or would it if we waited long enough? is there a way to make it try again without a restart?

is this the latest version of mq5?

1\. 'kill process' will send TERM signal to the process on Linux. In that case, the broker shutdown hook will be invoked and it will clean up the broker lock file. So assuming you were using kill -9

2\. If you kill -9 the broker process, and re-use the broker port to run for other application, and at same time expect to restart the broker on a different port using the same broker data store, you should remove the broker instance's lock file first. This is by design to protect the broker instance's data store.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTQwNg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This is now implemented with the exception of the case where a <tt>MessageFormatRuntimeException</tt> is thrown in <tt>AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</tt> or <tt>DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE</tt>. Currently the message is auto-acknowledged, whereas the JMS 2.0 API requires that the JMS provider behaves as if the unsuccessful call to <tt>receiveBody</tt> had not occurred and delivers the message again (without setting the redelivery flag) before any subsequent messages. Will leave this issue open until this is implemented.

Also, the behaviour after a <tt>MessageFormatRuntimeException</tt> is thrown in the <tt>CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</tt> and transacted cases needs to be tested.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTQ1OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The case where a <tt>MessageFormatRuntimeException</tt> is thrown in <tt>AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</tt> or <tt>DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE</tt> is now handled in the Java SE client and in JMSRA in TCP mode. However this case is still not handled correctly in JMSRA direct mode.

New tests have been added to check that a <tt>MessageFormatRuntimeException</tt> has the correct behaviour (in respect of message delivery) in all modes except JTA.

Remaining tasks:

*   Add support for the case where a <tt>MessageFormatRuntimeException</tt> is thrown in <tt>AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</tt> or <tt>DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE</tt> in JMSRA direct mode. (Tests already written).

*   Add tests for JTA transactions (both TCP and direct modes)

#193 already covers the implementation of (1). This issue requests implementation of (2).

Implementation work should not begin until JMS_SPEC_103 has been incorporated in the JMS 2.0 specification.

Implementation may also be dependent on the addition of a new feature to the Java EE platform specification to make the cluster name available to a resource adapter.

The issue is that when the message listener starts processing a message the queue is now empty so the client loads a new message onto the prefetch queue.

We have several consumers on this queue, our message processing time varies from a few seconds to a few minutes,
when the prefetch happens on a consumer that is processing a long running message that next message is blocked until it finishes even though we have other available consumers.

We run each consumer in its own jvm because we are executing 3rd party uploaded code which sometimes is poorly written causing excessive memory or cpu utilization.

As a work around without fully understanding the design of the jmsclient library
I modified the com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.SessionQueue class to have a peakWait method, also modified it to only work with the SequentialQueue class because I needed to add a peak method to that class as well.

then in com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.ConsumerReader

in the run method instead of calling the dequeWait I am calling peakWait
then wrapped the code making use of response in a try finally block and in the finally call the deque so that the queue will only be emptied after the message has been processed.

As for why you got that ClassCastException: I suspect it was because the com.sun.messaging.Destination class being used by your MDB was loaded using a different class loader from the one used by the resource adapter (which created the com.sun.messaging.jms.ra.TemporaryQueue). So Java didn't recognise one as a supertype of the other.

How did you get your MDB to compile the reference to com.sun.messaging.Destination? Did you include imq.jar in your application?

Hi Nigel,

in reply to your first comment:
Should I create a new issue requesting this feature or will you do so?

Regarding the your second comment: yes. We have some Glassfish jars including imqjmsra.jar in the classpath for compiling our application. But we do not package it/deploy it. Is there a workaround to get rid of the ClassCastException?

Many thanks

Please create a new feature request (e.g. ""Add support for consumer event listeners in JMSRA"".

Even if you are able to work around the TemporaryQueue class cast problem you will not be able to cast your connection to a com.sun.messaging.jms.Connection (which is the only class that implements setConsumerEventListener), since the resource adapter uses a completely different implementation class.

Current implementation have one constraint
Normally user does not have reason to use pattern for log file name but java.util.logging.FileHandler does allow pattern usage for log file. Following is javadoc comments for reference,

A pattern consists of a string that includes the following special components that will be replaced at runtime:

•""/"" the local pathname separator
•""%t"" the system temporary directory
•""%h"" the value of the ""user.home"" system property
•""%g"" the generation number to distinguish rotated logs
•""%u"" a unique number to resolve conflicts
•""%%"" translates to a single percent sign ""%""
If no ""%g"" field has been specified and the file count is greater than one, then the generation number will be added to the end of the generated filename, after a dot.
Thus for example a pattern of ""%t/java%g.log"" with a count of 2 would typically cause log files to be written on Solaris to /var/tmp/java0.log and /var/tmp/java1.log whereas on Windows 95 they would be typically written to C:\TEMP\java0.log and C:\TEMP\java1.log

Current implementation does not resolve pattern if specified. Mbean will throw exception if pattern is used.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTcwMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This issue covers the implementation of #178 in the JMSRA client (both direct mode and TCP mode). For the avoidance of doubt this issue covers only the JMS API. It does NOT cover message-driven beans.

The APi required is exactly as defined for #178. However when implementing this feature there is one additional issue to consider. This is how the new JMS 2.0 API for topic subscriptions interacts with JMSRA's existing ""shared subscriptions in a cluster"" feature.

The current ""shared subscriptions in a cluster"" feature (for applications using the JMS API)is defined in
[http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/doc.312/e24943/jmsra-properties.htm#gjzpg](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/doc.312/e24943/jmsra-properties.htm#gjzpg)

> Attempts by multiple connections to use the same client id do not result in an exception, provided that the connections are from different instances in the cluster.
> 
> Two or more subscriptions on the same topic with the same client id and (if the subscription is durable) the same durable subscription name are considered ""shared""; that is, they are treated as a single subscription, with each message being sent to only one of the participating subscriptions.
> 
> The sharing of subscriptions relies on client id being set, not only for durable subscriptions (which always require client id) but for non-durable subscriptions (which do not normally require client id). If the subscription is being created by the resource adapter for use by a message-driven bean (MDB), and client id is not set, then the resource adapter will set the client id to the name of the MDB. However if the subscription is being created programmatically using the JMS API, and client id is not set, then an exception will be thrown.

Now that the JMS 2.0 has decided to keep the existing behaviour of createDurableSubscriber (and createSubscriber), there is no overlap between the two features.

*   <tt>createDurableSubscriber</tt> and <tt>createSubscriber</tt> will continue to behave as they do now, with the existing non-spec-complaint ""shared subscriptions in a cluster"" behaviour (which allows duplicate clientId and requires clientID to be set even for non-durable subscriptions).

*   <tt>createSharedConsumer</tt> and <tt>createSharedDurableConsumer</tt> will exhibit the new JMS 2.0 behaviour (and so not support old-style JMSRA shared subscriptions)","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTcyMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

When this issue was first logged it was a case of implementing

*   [JMS_SPEC-73](https://java.net/jira/browse/JMS_SPEC-73 ""Define how messages from a topic are delivered to clustered application server instances"") (Define how messages from a topic are delivered to clustered application server instances) and
*   [JMS_SPEC-30](https://java.net/jira/browse/JMS_SPEC-30 ""Define mandatory activation config properties clientId and subscriptionName"") (Define mandatory activation config properties clientId and subscriptionName)

Since then there has been a change of requirement. [JMS_SPEC-73](https://java.net/jira/browse/JMS_SPEC-73 ""Define how messages from a topic are delivered to clustered application server instances"") has been deferred until a later version of JMS and so is not needed for MQ 5.0\. I am therefore removing the dependency on this issue.

Please remove the features defined in [JMS_SPEC-73](https://java.net/jira/browse/JMS_SPEC-73 ""Define how messages from a topic are delivered to clustered application server instances""), but make sure that the features defined in [JMS_SPEC-30](https://java.net/jira/browse/JMS_SPEC-30 ""Define mandatory activation config properties clientId and subscriptionName"") remain.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTc5MA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I've run jmsmarks2 with default, ""-Dimq.persist.minimizeWrites=false"" and ""-Dimq.persist.minimizeWritesLevel2=false"" flags for verification.
Here are the results.

*) default (imq.persist.minimize.Writes=true and imq.persist.minimizeWritesLevel2=true) : Mean Message/sec is 5,401.2
*) ""-Dimq.persist.minimizeWritesLevel2=false"" : Mean Message/sec is 5,317.4
*) ""-Dimq.persist.minimizeWrites=false"" : Mean Message/sec is 5,033.1

The performance is better with both the flags turned on. Closing this issue.

I've run jmsmarks2 with default, ""-Dimq.persist.minimizeWrites=false"" and ""-Dimq.persist.minimizeWritesLevel2=false"" flags for verification.
Here are the results.

*) default (imq.persist.minimize.Writes=true and imq.persist.minimizeWritesLevel2=true) : Mean Message/sec is 5,401.2
*) ""-Dimq.persist.minimizeWritesLevel2=false"" : Mean Message/sec is 5,317.4
*) ""-Dimq.persist.minimizeWrites=false"" : Mean Message/sec is 5,033.1

The performance is better with both the flags turned on. Closing this issue.

This is referred to as the ""provider-specific queue name"" to distinguish it from the JNDI name.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY2OTk4Ng==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

```
@Stateless
public class MessageSender {

    @Inject

    Queue queue;

    public void sendMessage(String message) {

The following message receiver works fine:

```

        return ""Received "" + message;
    }
}
```

But the following one does not receive the message:

```
@MessageDriven(mappedName = ""java:global/jms/myQueue"")
public class MessageReceiverAsync implements MessageListener {

    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message message) {

This is a GlassFish server side bug - The MDB for the async sample listens on a Topic whereas the @JMSDestintionDefinition specifies it as className=""javax.jms.Queue"" (see below JMSRA debug logging in server.log). If send a message to Topic 'queue1234', the MDB receives the message.

Case:
1. Create a glassfish cluster with 2 instances.

asadmin create-cluster cluster1
asadmin create-local-instance --cluster cluster1 --systemproperties HTTP_LISTENER_PORT=1111:HTTP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT=1112:IIOP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT=1113:IIOP_LISTENER_PORT=1114:JMX_SYSTEM_CONNECTOR_PORT=1115:IIOP_SSL_MUTUALAUTH_PORT=1116:JMS_PROVIDER_PORT=1117:ASADMIN_LISTENER_PORT=1118 instance1
asadmin create-local-instance --cluster cluster1 --systemproperties HTTP_LISTENER_PORT=2221:HTTP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT=2222:IIOP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT=2223:IIOP_LISTENER_PORT=2224:JMX_SYSTEM_CONNECTOR_PORT=2225:IIOP_SSL_MUTUALAUTH_PORT=2226:JMS_PROVIDER_PORT=2227:ASADMIN_LISTENER_PORT=2228 instance2

2. Change the cluster config to make its jmsservice LOCAL.

asadmin set configs.config.cluster1-config.jms-service.type=LOCAL

3. Start the cluster.

asadmin start-cluster cluster1

4. Try to create jms destination against the cluster.

asadmin create-jmsdest --target cluster1 --desttype topic topic1

The destination cannot be created! I debugged jmsra a little bit, and I see that ResouceAdaptor.getJMXServiceURLList() returns null to the glassfish admin CLI create-jmsdest, then the command failed for not getting the JMX urls of the brokers. By debugging it deeper, I traced that PortMapperTable got entries without JMX url from MQ server.

cluster_discovery tcp CLUSTER_DISCOVERY 0
portmapper tcp PORTMAPPER 2601 [imqvarhome=D:\glassfish_trunk\glassfish3\glassfish\nodes\localhost-domain1\instance1\imq,imqhome=D:\glassfish_trunk\glassfish3\mq,sessionid=5525419700564496384]
admin tcp ADMIN 63100
jms tcp NORMAL 63099
cluster tcp CLUSTER 63101

This happens with cluster only, I tried the same with a local glassfish instance (jmsservice=LOCAL) and it works fine.

This is indeed the case if the subscription is non-durable (though the <tt>clientId</tt> is actually set to the name of the MDB combined with any cluster name).

However if the subscription is durable then if <tt>clientId</tt> is unset (and the new <tt>subscriptionScope</tt> is also unset) then an exception is thrown during deployment (the code that does this is <tt>EndpointConsumer.setIsDurable)</tt>).

The product documentation is probably incorrect. However JMS 2.0 section 12.1 states ""Setting this property [ <tt>clientId</tt> ] is always optional. If <tt>subscriptionScope</tt> is set (to <tt>instance</tt> or <tt>cluster</tt>) then this property must not be set.""

This means that JMSRA needs to be changed to allow <tt>clientId</tt> to be unset in the case where <tt>subscriptionScope</tt> is unset and <tt>subscriptionDurability</tt> is <tt>Durable</tt>.

The simplest way to achieve this is to extend the existing code that generates <tt>clientId</tt> in the non-durable case to cover the durable case as well. This code is in <tt>EndpointConsumer._init</tt>. If the application server is not clustered then {{clientId} should be set to the name of the MDB (as passed in from GlassFish via a private API). If the application server is clustered then {{clientId} should be set to the name of the MDB combined with the ""group name"" which identifies the cluster.

Another way to achieve this is to use a shared durable subscription. That's a possibility (perhaps for the future), but I think it is safer and more consistent to make this consistent with non-durable subscriptions.

In addition, a check should be made to enforce the JMS 2.0 rule that <tt>clientId} must not be set if {{subscriptionScope</tt> is set.

This is wrong. The second call to createConnection should throw an exception as it cannot create two connections with the same clientId. It is very misleading to return a connection but with clientID unset.

A JMSServiceException is thrown internally, but it is caught in DirectConnection._setClientID and logged as a warning:

```
WARNING: MQJMSRA_DC2001: connectionId=2641708964950071552:_setClientID():JMSService.setClientId():JMSServiceException=setClientId:
set client ID failed. Connection ID: 2641708964950071552, Client ID: MyClientID, Shareable: false, nameSpace: null
```

The JMSServiceException wraps a BrokerException with the message ""conflict w/ clientID"" (sic), but this is not reported in the log.

This issue relates to direct mode (<tt>DirectConnection</tt>), but TCP mode should be checked as well/

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='Big5'?>

The current behavior is 'imqcmd restart broker' always pass ""nofailover=false"" regardless -nofailover option specified or not, which causes un-intended takeover if the broker does not restart fast enough.

The MQ Administration Guide and 'imqcmd -help' only specifies that -nofailover option for 'imqcmd shutdown bkr', which is correct.

This has been addressed in 5.0.1, 4.5u2p3 and 4.4u2p9 to workaround this particular ""Bad Sysmessage ID"" exception due to database corruption when it occurs on takeover processing,

*   First the broker will try to recover the real SysMessageID from the packet data in the MESSAGE column
*   If the packet data corrupted as well, the packet data is read as byte[] and placed in a BytesMessage body in DMQ, then the ""bad Sysmessage ID"" row is removed. The following DMQ message properties will contain details

This is not a MQ issue. MQ is correctly throwing a <tt>javax.jms.JMSRuntimeException</tt> (which is a subtype of <tt>RuntimeException</tt>) when <tt>JMSConsumer.setMessageListener</tt> is called in a Java EE web or EJB container, as allowed by the spec.

From separate discussions your problem is how the GlassFish container handles such exceptions. If a <tt>RuntimeException</tt> exception is thrown by a EJB business method then the exception is logged by the GlassFish container in the server log. However you have discovered that if a <tt>RuntimeException</tt> exception is thrown in a WebSocket callback then nothing is logged.

This looks to me like a bug in the WebSocket container in GlassFish and has nothing directly to do with MQ. I can reproduce it without using MQ, but simply by throwing a {{RuntimeException} exception from your code.

```
@OnMessage
    public void onMessage(final String message, final Session client) {
        Logger.getLogger(SampleWebSocket.class.getName()).log(Level.INFO, ""SampleWebSocket.onMessage called"");
        throw new RuntimeException(""Ooh la la"");
    }
```

This bug needs to be investigated by the WebSocket team. However since you've logged this in the MQ issue tracker there's no way I can reassign it. So I'm closing this as not being a bug in MQ. Please open a new issue in the GlassFish issue tracker.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MDUxNA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

```
@MessageDriven(mappedName = ""java:global/jms/HandlingEventRegistrationAttemptQueue"")
```

However if if the queue or topic used by a MDB is configured using the standard <tt>destinationLookup</tt> activation property then there **is** a need to specify the activation property <tt>destinationType</tt>:

```
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = { 
   @ActivationConfigProperty( 
      propertyName = ""destinationLookup"", propertyValue = ""java:global/jms/MyQueue""),
   @ActivationConfigProperty(
      propertyName = ""destinationType"", propertyValue = ""javax.jms.Queue"")
})
```

There doesn't seem to be a good reason for this. Given that JMSRA is MQ-specific then if <tt>destinationLookup</tt> is specified it should be possible to use private API to determine whether the destination is a queue or topic.

Note that if the non-standard activation property <tt>destination</tt> is used to specify the physical queue or topic name then it **will** still be necessary to specify the <tt>destinationType</tt> property.

It seems imqbrokerd and imqbrokersvc.exe always set -Xmx, -Xms and -Xss although it is provided by -vmargs.

In imqbrokerd, there is:
_def_jvm_args=""-Xms192m -Xmx192m -Xss192k""

So if we run ""imqbrokerd ... -vmargs -Xmx512m"", it will result in ""java ... -Xms192m -Xmx192m -Xss192k -Xmx512m"".

Although technically the last one property with duplicate name will take effect in JVM, I am afraid of that something like ""java ... -Xms192m -Xmx192m -Xss192k -Xmx512m"" may confuse the user a little bit. It is expected that the default jvm args -Xms192m/-Xmx192m/-Xss192k can be removed if -vmargs -Xmx/-Xms/-Xss ... are provided.

But actually it is MQ issue instead.

[Bug Description]
The error message shouldn't be output when update the broker by excuting ""%GF_HOME%\mq\bin\imqcmd update bkr -o imq.system.max_size=100b"" successfully

[Operations]
1、Setting the mq property by executing ""%GF_HOME%\mq\bin\imqbrokerd -Dimq.system.max_size=100m"" in an
admin-console called ""console1"". There's no error messages output in console1
Note:%GF_HOME% is Glassfish v4 Install Directory.

2、After executing ""%GF_HOME%\mq\bin\imqcmd update bkr -o imq.system.max_size=100b"" in another admin-console
called ""console2"" successfully, the following error message output in console1.

===========================================================================
IMQ: ERROR: DestinationManagerConfig?: cannot parse internal value of MaxTotalMsgBytes?: java.lang.NumberFormatException?: For input string: ""100b""
IMQ: WARNING: DestinationManagerConfig?: Problem encountered while getting attribute MaxTotalMsgBytes?:
java.lang.NumberFormatException?: For input string: ""100m"":
java.lang.NumberFormatException?: For input string: ""100m""
IMQ: ERROR: DestinationManagerConfig? notification jmx.attribute.change: encountered problem while getting old
value of attribute MaxTotalMsgBytes?: javax.management.MBeanException
===========================================================================

[My Suggestion]
when excuting ""%GF_HOME%\mq\bin\imqcmd update bkr -o imq.system.max_size=100b"" successfully in
a console, the error message shouldn't be output in another admin-console.

The above code snippet is in GlassFish server code base, not MQ code base. In a later email, David Zhou referred to a test case via direct JNDI access com.sun.enterprise.naming.impl.SerialInitContextFactory - a non-standard path to access a JMS resource in GlassFish server.

1\. For standard Java SE JMS MQ standalone client, MQ ConnectionFacrory.createConnection(String username, String password) works as expected

2\. When running in Java EE EJB container, though this would be in GlassFish server land, according to EJB specification, how sign-on information is used for a ConnectionFactory resource depends AuthenticationType is APPLICATION or CONTAINER (annotation) or res-auth is Application or Container in descriptor. To use explicit programmatic sign-on from a bean, it should configure the ConnectionFactory with AuthenticationType APPLICATION or res-auth Application. By default AuthenticationType is CONTAINER and res-auth is Container

3\. When AuthenticationType is CONTAINER or res-auth is Container, one can configure username and password for a ConnectionFactory resource as following

```
asadmin create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.ConnectionFactory --property UserName=myname:Password=mypasswd jms/myConnectionFactory

The above setting works as expected with MQ 4.1 - ie. client get expected exception, e.g.:

The bug is now fixed in 5.0.1 and 4.5.2p3 and 4.4u2p9

This was followed by screeds of similar java.lang.IllegalStateException messages similar to the one shown above.

In the end I had had to remove the fs370 directory and have the broker reinitialise the storage to get the application up and
running, and in so doing lost all messages that were in flight at the time the problem arose. (As the broker was running in a
cluster I had to repeat the same process on the other node).

The only other issue that I could find that relates to this kind of error message was #199 but that is addressed in MQ 5.0\. I have
commented on that issue to ask if the fix will be backported to 4.5.2\.

Firstly, the problem was not a broker storage corruption. A bug (14497787) in the store prevented the txnlog recovery to complete and left the store in a runtime state unable to accept new operations.

5.0 passed all nightly/milestone regression tests as well as QA tests for all supported new features, and it has been released. For official word, please refer to official announcement/statement. 5.0 is also included with GlassFish 4.0 release

Thanks for clarifying. If the storage is not corrupted, what are the recovery steps for 4.5.2 to allow the broker to resume normal operations and process messages that have backed up in the queues?

```

The problem is that UTF-8 causes the XID column to take 3 times the bytes as normal and because it is 256 byte (should be 255) the table can't be created because there is a limit on key size for MySQL.

A workaround is to create the 2 tables which weren't create manually:

```
CREATE TABLE MQTMLRJMSBG41SSemRecSys1005apaxode (
    XID VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    LOG_RECORD MEDIUMBLOB NOT NULL,
    NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    BROKER_ID VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    CREATED_TS BIGINT NOT NULL,
    UPDATED_TS BIGINT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(XID)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `MQJMSBG41SSemRecSys1005apaxode` (
  `NAME` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `BROKER_ID` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `CREATED_TS` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `UPDATED_TS` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`NAME`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
```

This will also prevent the system to try to recreate the tables and fail with a table already exists error.

It might help to use the following config but I didn't tested this:

```
imq.persist.jdbc.vendorName.tableoption=CHARSET=latin1
```

Note:%GF_HOME% is Glassfish v4 Install Directory.

2、After executing ""%GF_HOME%\mq\bin\imqcmd list svc -b localhost:0"", the following error
message appeared.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warming: [C4003]: Error occurred on connection creation [localhost:0]. - cause: jav
a.net.ConnectException: connect: Address is invalid on local machine, or port is
not valid on remote machine
Error while connecting to the broker on host 'localhost' and port '0'.
com.sun.messaging.jms.JMSException: [C4003]: Error occurred on connection creati
on [localhost:0]. - cause: java.net.ConnectException: connect: Address is invali
d on local machine, or port is not valid on remote machine
Please verify that there is a broker running on the specified host and port or
use the '-b' option to specify the correct broker host and port.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[My Suggestion]
I think that firstly, mq should not allow setting the port of mq broker as ""0"", secondly,when user
sets the port of mq broker as ""0"", mq should give a error message, for example,

""[B4027]: Invalid property value: port=0"" in the admin-console

We found a problem that some persistent messages are lost in Open MQ 4.4 and we have also confirmed that the same problem is reproduced in Open MQ 5.0\. Our developers modified the source code to fix the problem and we would appreciate if you could check if our fix is correct. We have also found a workaround for this problem and we would like to check if the workaround is correct.

I understand a bug report should be sent to the JIRA system. However, I am posting to the mailing list as I noticed it takes very long time to get response in JIRA in some cases. If I need to open a case in JIRA, please let me know. Thank you very much for your understanding.

Problem:

Persistent messages exceeding 1MB (1024 x 1024 byte) are lost.

Steps to reproduce:

This is a typical example to reproduce the problem but this can be reproduced in several ways.

1\. Start message broker with default setting.

2\. Send 50 messages in persistent mode. Each message exceeds 1MB (1024 x 1024 byte).

3\. Receive all messages which have been sent in step 2\.

4\. Restart message broker.

5\. Send 100 messages in persistent mode. Each message exceeds 1MB (1024 x 1024 byte).

6\. Restart message broker.

When the above steps are performed,

We expect 100 messages are stored after restarting, as 100 messages have been sent in step 5.

However, only 50 messages have been stored and the rest of 50 messages are lost.

We found more cases in which the problem is reproduced.

*   Execute imqcmd purge dst in step 2.

*   Message expires in step 2\. and moves to DMQ.

Cause:

We found a problem in loading persistent messages and file pool is executed twice.

Workaround:

We found a workaround by specifying imq.persist.file.destination.message.filepool.limit=0 to turn off the file pooling function. Our understanding is that setting this parameter only disables file pool and all other functionalities are not affected. Is it correct?

Tentative Fix:

We have modified the soruce code for OpenMQ 4.4 as shown in the attachment file and confirmed the problem is fixed. We'd appreciate if you could check if our fix is correct.

In RandomAccessStore file, hasMoreElements method in internal class FileEnumeration determines the value of scanned by itr and index at the begining.

The value of index is increased in hasMoreElements method. We think your intention is to set true to scanned at last when itr is null by executing hasMoreElements and nextElements repeatedly.

However, as hasMoreElements method is executed again only when it returned true, scanned remains false in case hasMoreElements has returned false.

As a result of our investigation, we have added lines at the end of method which set true to scanned based on itr and index. This has been modified so that scanned is set as true when false has been returned.

Regards,

Takuji

--------------------
We've reproduced the problem in using this test program.

MessageProducer producer = s.createProducer(dst);

ObjectMessage msg = s.createObjectMessage();

byte[] b = new byte[1024*1024];

msg.setObject(b);

for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)

{ producer.send(msg, DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT, 4, (long) 3000000); }

Here is the more detailed steps which I have done.

1\. Start Glassfish

asasdmin start-domain

2\. Set JMS Service Type as REMOTE by Glassfish Web Admin

3\. Create Connection Factory and Destination Resource by Glassfish Web Admin

4\. Restart Glassfish

asadmin stop-domain

asadmin start-domain

5\. Clear the MQ environment

imqbrokerd -remove instance

6\. Start broker with default setting

Imqbrokerd

7\. Create a destination queue. (The bug is not reproduced, if you skip this step. )

imqcmd create dst -t q -n JMSQueue

8\. Send 50 messages in persistent mode. Each message exceeds 1MB (1024 x 1024 byte or more).

9\. Receive all messages which have been sent in step 7\.

10\. Restart broker

imqcmd shutdown bkr

imqbrokerd

11\. Send 100 messages in persistent mode. Each message exceeds 1MB (1024 x 1024 byte or more).

12\. Check messages. The result of imqcmd list dst is 100.

The default maximum size of the dead message queue is 10Mbytes. However, the actual message size becomes more than 10MBytes. Old messages are not discarded.

Follow this step to reproduce issue.

1\. Delete instance.
>imqbrokerd -remove instance

2\. Start message broker.
>imqbrokerd

3\. Send 512Kbytes message 20 times.
ie.) Set expiry time as 1 min when sending a message.
MessageProducer.send(message, DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT, 4, 60000);

4\. Confirm the messages which were sent in step 3\. have moved to dead message queue.
Wait for 3 minutes if expiry time has been set as 1 min.

The expired messages move to dead message queue after ( Value set in the above send API + imq.message.expiration.interval property x 2 ). imq.message.expiration.interval is set as 60 second.

>imq list dst

*   Check that ""Count"" for physical destination is 0.
*   Check that ""Count"" for dead message queue (mq.sys.dmq) is more than 1.

5\. Check maximum message size in dead message queue and current actual size.
>imqcmd query dst -t q -n mq.sys.dmq

*   Check ""Current Message Bytes"" > ""Actual"".
*   Check ""Max Total Message Bytes"".

6\. Send 512Kbytes message 10 times.
ie.) Set expiry time as 1 min when sending a message.
MessageProducer.send(message, DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT, 4, 60000);

7\. Confirm the messages which were sent in step 6\. have moved to dead message queue.
Wait for 3 minutes if expiry time has been set as 1 min.

The expired messages move to dead message queue after ( Value set in the above send API + imq.message.expiration.interval property x 2 ). imq.message.expiration.interval is set as 60 second.

>imq list dst

*   Check that ""Count"" for physical destination is 0.
*   Check that ""Count"" for dead message queue (mq.sys.dmq) is more than 20.

8\. Check maximum message size in dead message queue and current actual size.
>imqcmd query dst -t q -n mq.sys.dmq

*   Check ""Current Message Bytes"" > ""Actual"".
*   Check ""Max Total Message Bytes"".

Bug:
30 messages are stored in the dead message queue and the toal is 15MBytes which exceeds the maximum 10Mbytes. At step 5, the total size of dead message queue exceeds 10Mbytes. The old messages should be deleted when the messages sent in step 6 are moved the dead message queue. However, the messages are not deleted and 30 messages are stored in dead message queue.

For your information, if the following command is executed between step 2 and 3, the bug is not reproduced. If this command is executed, 20 messages are stored in step 8\.

(note: the issue is not specific to enhanced cluster or cluster)

1\. start a 2-broker enhanced cluster
2\. send 1 message by connecting to broker1
3\. apply fault injection to have broker throw exception before do transaction rollback
4\. a consumer receives the message in a XA transaction (using XAResourceImpl, e.g. JMSJCA path) by connecting to broker1
<== The consumer will get exception on XAResource.rollback due to fault injection at #3
5\. close consumer connection in #4
6\. start another consumer to receive the message in a XA transaction by connecting to broker2, then end, commit
<== broker1 will log error B3062 ""Acknowledgement... for Transaction id xxx exists""

The following is from a customer case in a 4.4u2p8 broker log. The broker error [B3062] is repeately (due to continuous rollback) logged for the same message id and transaction id (in 'Transaction id 3271372694595421696 exists in the store already')

The steps to enable secure jmx connector in GF:

asadmin set configs.config.server-config.admin-service.jmx-connector.system.security-enabled=true
asadmin change-admin-password (respond to the prompts)
asadmin enable-secure-admin
asadmin restart-domain (as prompted in the output from enable-secure-admin)
asadmin list-jms-resources (users first need to run any asadmin command that contacts the DAS which now has secure admin enabled. This caches the DAS cert in the local GlassFish truststore (in the ~/.gfclient/truststore file).)

added JMX support from broker to use GlassFish server secure rmi registry port, custom JMX clients can do following
to connect to the ssljmxrmi service of a JMSRA managed broker that uses GlassFish server secure rmi registry

```
env.put(JMXConnector.CREDENTIALS, credentials);
env.put(""com.sun.jndi.rmi.factory.socket"", new SslRMIClientSocketFactory());
final JMXServiceURL jmxURL = new JMXServiceURL(jmxServiceURL);
final JMXConnector jmxConnector = JMXConnectorFactory.connect(jmxURL, env);

where jmxServiceURL is the JMX service URL for broker ssljmxrmi service which can be obtained either from the broker log on startup or by getJMXServiceURL() method from com.sun.messaging.AdminConnectionConfiguration
```

1\. Before start broker, run imqkeytool to setup keystore so that broker ssljmx service can use it
2\. JMSRA need to pass the following to broker in order to have broker use GlassFish secure RMI registry port
-useRmiRegistry
-rmiRegistryPort <GlassFish-server-rmi-registry-port>
-Dimq.jmx.connector.activelist=ssljmxrmi <== This turns off broker jmxrmi service and enables ssljmxrmi service

as well as imq.keystore.password

3\. JMX application client user needs to do following
a) Using Java keytool, import broker's certificate to $HOME/.gfclient/truststore
b) run JMX application client with Java system property
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=$

{HOME}

/.gfclient/truststore

Because of a jconsole bug mentioned in [GLASSFISH-20671](https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-20671 ""enable-/disable-secure-admin should set/clear SSL on JMX also""), jconsole can not be used to access broker mbeans when broker uses GlassFish server secure RMI registry.

Thanks for reporting this.

The legacy Sun Java System Message Queue web forum has now been moved to the OTN Community [here](https://forums.oracle.com/community/developer/english/archived_forums/fusion_middleware_archived_forums/application_server_archived_forums/java_system_message_queue) and made read-only.

The best place to ask questions about Message Queue is the email-only user forum users@mq.java.net [here](https://java.net/projects/mq/lists). However for users who are using Message Queue as part of GlassFish, there is also the GlassFish user mailing list and web forum (one is a mirror of the other) [here](http://glassfish.java.net/forum.html).

There's also a JMS web forum , which is now [here](https://forums.oracle.com/community/developer/english/java/java_enterprise_%26_remote_computing/java_message_service_%28jms%29). This is intended mainly for questions about JMS rather than about specific implementations.

We'll review and update the website links.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MDk1Ng==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

It is therefore difficult to make use of the Java client code from within an OSGI project because of this, as the com.sun.messaging packages cannot be resolved by the OSGI framework (Apache Felix) at runtime.

The standard solution would be to ""repackage"" the jars as bundles, using the maven bundle plugin. Even this is difficult, however, as the jars are no longer available separately on maven central. Post 4.5.2, a zip (mq-distribution) is instead provided making it hard to declare dependencies on the particular projects your require.

The lack of OSGI metadata seems to be in contrast to the other Glassfish sub-projects (e.g shoal, grizzly), so it can come as a surprise to the unsuspecting developer.

I was able to reproduce the issue but this is expected behavior and not a bug.

According to Amy,our MQ engineer:

The implementation for MapMessage.getBoolean(null) is consistent with how we treat 'null' value on message properties where to confirm JMS spec, in Boolean case, Boolean.valueOf(null) needs to be used. Boolean.valueOf(null) returns false, hence the 'false' return.

additionally MapMessage.getBoolean javadoc says following

*   @exception MessageFormatException if this type conversion is invalid.
    */

Since Java Boolean.valueOf converts 'null' to 'false', hence not a MessageFormatException case.

@nigeldeakin said:
The JMS spec doesn't define what should happen in this case (though it is clearly invalid and an exception of some kind should result). Throwing a <tt>JMSException</tt> would probably be valid, but throwing a more specific unchecked exception would be valid too, in my opinion.

As a general policy, I don't think the existence of <tt>JMSException</tt> should force the provider to catch every possible unchecked exception (e.g. <tt>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</tt>) and wrap it in a <tt>JMSException</tt>. The only cases where a JMSException must be thrown are in the cases listed in the API documentation, which relate to using an inappropriate method to read data from the byte array.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTAwMg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

A negative timestamp has no meaning, so it would be helpful if MQ threw an exception when an attempt was made to set a negative value. The JMS specification does not require that the exception that is thrown is a JMSException, but this seems to be the most appropriate exception to throw.

Note that this method is not intended for use by client applications and any value set by the client application will always be overridden (see the [javadoc](http://jms-spec.java.net/2.0/apidocs/javax/jms/Message.html#setJMSExpiration%28long%29)):

The JMS spec doesn't define what should happen in this case (though it is clearly invalid and an exception of some kind should result). Throwing a <tt>JMSException</tt> would probably be valid, but throwing a more specific unchecked exception such as a {{NullPointerException }} would be valid too, in my opinion.

As a general policy, I don't think the existence of <tt>JMSException</tt> should force the provider to catch every possible unchecked exception (e.g. <tt>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</tt>) and wrap it in a <tt>JMSException</tt>.

The JMS spec doesn't define what should happen in this case (though it is clearly invalid and an exception of some kind should result). Throwing a <tt>JMSException</tt> would probably be valid, but throwing a more specific unchecked exception such as a {{NullPointerException }} would be valid too, in my opinion.

As a general policy, I don't think the existence of <tt>JMSException</tt> should force the provider to catch every possible unchecked exception (e.g. <tt>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</tt>) and wrap it in a <tt>JMSException</tt>. The only cases where a <tt>JMSException</tt> must be thrown are in the cases listed in the API documentation.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTA5Ng==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Instead, newer versions of these jars only appear to be available via a distribution zip, ""mq-distribution"".

So far as I can see, this makes it impossible to declare simple dependencies in a project's pom.xml file.

For example, a project making use of the Java client API could previously have declared a simple dependency like so...

<dependency>
<groupId>org.glassfish.mq</groupId>
<artifactId>imq</artifactId>
<version>4.5.2</version>
</dependency>

...but can no longer do so with versions newer than 4.5.2.

This also affects users of the embedded broker feature, as the new broker jars are unpublished.

Thanks for looking at this. I've included what I use in my poms below, on the off chance it helps someone else.

I gave this a go this morning and found I was able to use the JMS Client with a dependency like this...

<dependency>
<groupId>org.glassfish.mq</groupId>
<artifactId>imq</artifactId>
<version>$

{openmq.version}</version>
</dependency>

...and was able to fire up and contact an embedded broker with dependencies like this...

In all cases, $openmq.version was 5.0.

So that is both of my use cases sorted.

This causes the broker startup to fail (for version 5.0, version 4.5.2 logged an exception but started anyway).

This seems to be because of a bug in com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.persist.file.TransactionLogManager, within the method initTransactionLogOnStartUp().

When the line...

SizeString filesize = config.getSizeProperty(TXNLOG_FILE_SIZE_PROP, DEFAULT_TXNLOG_FILE_SIZE);

...fails to read a value from the properties file, it uses DEFAULT_TXNLOG_FILE_SIZE. This constant is 10MB, expressed as bytes (10 * 1024 * 1024). The property is interpreted as KB, however, so an attempt is made to set the length of the transaction log file to 10 GB.

Adding a line like this to the config.properties file proved to be an acceptable workaround:
imq.persist.file.txnLog.file.size=1024

A stack trace like is is thrown, presumably because the value being passed to RandomAccessFile.setLength is too big:

Just thought I would provide a little background on the scenario I was working on when I ran into this.

I was creating a ""standalone"" broker instance, that could be run anywhere with no external dependencies. This was so that we could easily test our integration with OpenMQ as part of our automated tests (e.g. in a JUNIT test).

This meant that I couldn't depend on an external OpenMQ installation existing somewhere on the file system. All of the jars came in via Maven, so all I needed to worry about was creating the directory structure (imqhome and varhome) and the configuration files.

I found that, in 4.5.2, just creating empty .properties files worked fine. With 5.0, I found that I had to set the property mentioned above, but no others.

After that, the embedded broker worked fine!","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTEzOQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The broker has a set of fallback properties hard-coded. However these fallback properties do not include all properties in default.properties (for this reason, the broker should be configured to locate the default.properties which is under 'IMQ_HOME/lib', as documented in the Java Developer's Guide [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18930_01/html/821-2440/gjmtr.html#scrolltoc](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18930_01/html/821-2440/gjmtr.html#scrolltoc)). imq.persist.file.txnLog.file.size default setting is set in TransactionLogManager and 5.0 has a size unit bug, this bug, for that default value.

We are killing the node with:

kill -9 <glassfish-pid>

It would be great if the dangling connections could be closed automatically.

Using GlassFish 3.1.2.2 EMBEDDED broker on Linux, I can reproduce the CLOSE_WAIT state with a simple STOMP client after the client terminate normally. However when the broker is configured as LOCAL (jms-service in domain.xml), the problem is reproduced.

The EMBEDDED broker in GlassFish 3.1.2.2 uses Grizzly in GlassFish modules/ which has version Grizzly NIO framework 1.9.50
The LOCAL broker in GlassFish 3.1.2.2 uses Grizzly NIO framework 1.9.36 in glassfish3/mq/lib

I found the problem. In grizzle the ConnectionCloseHandler Interface the function remotlyClosed was renamed to remotelyClosed and therefore it was not called anymore in the StompServer. The change was between version 1.9.36 and 1.9.37.

```

We are running JMS in embedded mode and it is doing recovery on restart.

The problem here is that the JMS system is started for automatic recovery and the stomp bridge is started too. Unfortunately the classloader for the recovery thread seams to have problems to load UnifiedConnectionImpl.

I also added some details in the following thread:
[https://www.java.net/forum/topic/glassfish/glassfish/noclassdeffounderror-when-using-stomp-bridge-openmq-one-cluster-node](https://www.java.net/forum/topic/glassfish/glassfish/noclassdeffounderror-when-using-stomp-bridge-openmq-one-cluster-node)

The following work around works:

1.  Undeployed application
2.  Restarted both nodes
3.  Redeployed application

Thanks for the report, the clear detail, your investigations and analysis, and the workaround.
As you suggest the problem appears to be that the JMSRA resource adapter does not appear
to be available to the class loader that is used during this recovery operation.
Obviously this should be investigated further.

Your report reminded me of this question on the forum

cryptocurrency market, unlike any other market in the world, is very 
volatile. And investors that are involved in the market have, at one 
point or the other, faced large losses. The reason for the losses can be 
and are multifold. However, in essence, they are all the same; money is 
lost. 
 
In the 
cryptocurrency market in specific, the reason can be anything from 
technology shortcomings to general speculation caused volatility. One of 
the major reasons for the loss in the cryptocurrency market especially 
is lack of discipline or blatant overconfidence. 
 
Irrespective

ball-game. It can be one of the most challenging times in the life of a

• Isssue
The behavior of limitBehavior is different between REJECT_NEWEST and REMOVE_OLDEST/REMOVE_LOWPRIORITY.

• Steps to reproduce issue
Compile sample program. Set CLASSPATH for glassfish\lib\gf-client.jar and compile the attached program.
Set Connection Factory and Destination in Glassfish.

Create physical destination for message broker as follows:

imqcmd create dst -t q -n JMSQueue -u admin -pw admin
imqcmd update dst -t q -n JMSQueue -o maxTotalMsgBytes=5k -u admin -pw admin -f

Setting maxTotalMsgBytes=5k sets limit on the storage in Physical destination.
After the above steps are executed, set limitBehavior option as follows:

oSetting REMOVE_OLDEST/REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY
1.imqcmd update dst -t q -n JMSQueue -o limitBehavior=REMOVE_OLDEST -u admin -pw admin -f
or
imqcmd update dst -t q -n JMSQueue -o limitBehavior=REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY -u admin -pw admin -f
2.Send 1KB data x 5 times.
3.Verify the above. imqcmd list dst
4.5 messages are stored.

oSetting REJECT_NEWEST
1.imqcmd update dst -t q -n JMSQueue -o limitBehavior=REJECT_NEWEST -u admin -pw admin -f
2.Send 1KB data x 5 times. *Error occurs at 5th send.
3.Verify the above. Imqcmd list dst
4.4 messages are stored.

Based on the above results,
For REJECT_NEWEST, new data is rejected if existing data size + new data size is larger than maxTotalMsgBytes.
On the other hand, for REMOVE_OLDEST/REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY, data is stored if existing data size is smaller than maxTotalMsgBytes.

It is possible that 1KB message is sent x 4 times and 10MB is sent at 5th time when 5KB is limit. I have attached the sample program to reproduce the problem and the log file.

The only part of that stack trace which involves MQ is

```
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.QueueReceiverImpl cannot be cast to com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.MQMessageConsumer
	at com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.JMSConsumerImpl.initialiseConsumer(JMSConsumerImpl.java:99)
	at com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.JMSContextImpl.createConsumer(JMSContextImpl.java:755)
```

The <tt>JMSConsumerImpl</tt> class is the implementation of the JMS 2.0 interface <tt>javax.jms.JMSContext</tt>, and was added in MQ 5.0\. So you can't be using MQ 4.5.2.

This is a bit strange because the class <tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.QueueReceiverImpl</tt> **can** be cast to <tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.MQMessageConsumer</tt>.
<tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.QueueReceiverImpl</tt> extends <tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.MessageConsumerImpl</tt> which implements the interface <tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.MessageConsumer</tt>.

I also note that you're using the MQ Java SE client, rather than using the resource adapter (which is what you would normally do in a GlassFish application). So perhaps you're getting your connection factory from an unusual source, which is messing up the class loaders.

If I write a simple Java SE application which creates a <tt>QueueConnectionFactory</tt>, calls <tt>createContext</tt> to create a <tt>JMSContext</tt> and then calls <tt>createConsumer</tt> to create a <tt>JMSConsumer</tt>, this creates a <tt>QueueReceiverImpl</tt> performs exactly the same cast as is shown in the stack trace. Which works just fine.

To make any progress with this I think we would need a test case, preferably as simple as possible.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTMzMQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

However, this does:

Selector.compile(""(dataClass = 'node.run' AND ( OR )"")

In the first case, the client is able to subscribe to the topic and no exception is thrown. However, when the broker compiles the same selector and then calls match() with the data from the message it is processing the expected exception is thrown:

From what I observed, this prevents the message from being delivered to subscribers; messages that match the given ""dataClass"" will accumulate in the broker until their TTL expires.

The call to ""match(new HashMap(0), new HashMap(0))"" at the end of compile() is not sufficient to validate the the selector.

Also, I've noticed that ActiveMQ, OpenJMS, and JBossMQ have used javacc-generated parsers to handle this (google for ""SelectorParser.jj""). Perhaps this would be a more robust solution?

Tweaked things some more; made it so that during compile() short-circuit optimization is off; this state is reset at the end of compile(). This means that shortCircuit is no longer some global switch; it is false during the ""complile"" phase and then set to true at ""run-time"". Here's the diff:

Hi foboz,

The Selector.convertToRPN() works as expected (see method comments in source file) for
""(dataClass = 'node.run' AND ( OR ))""

as the debug shows the compiledSelector contains following after convertToRPN
[101,dataClass][102,node.run][9,=][200,&][201,|][1,OR][2,AND]

In this case, the reason that the selector format error is only detected at runtime when a matched (ie. a TRUE is on stack when processing AND_MARK) message comes in is because the last step at compilation (consumer creation time) only tests non-match case (ie. a FALSE is on stack when processing AND_MARK) for it uses empty properties/headers.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTM0OQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The fix is do both TRUE and FALSE tests for shortCircuit at selector compile time. This additional test can also be turned off by set broker property
imq.selector.shortCircuitCompileTimeTest=false (default true)

Fixed in 5.0.1 build7

If this is the wrong place, please guide me in the right direction.

I'm using the open-mq5.0 library from [https://mq.java.net/](https://mq.java.net/), other versions might be affected too.

This especially striked me when manually starting a UMSServlet connected to an embedded broker on Tomcat and trying to cleanly destroy() it:

com.sun.messaging.ums.service.CacheSweeper can never exit correctly due to assignment which will always be true in line 169 in run() method:

```
**com.sun.messaging.ums.service.CacheSweeper.java** public void run() {
   while (isRunning = true) {
      // do some work....
   }
 }
}
```

A not so important thing that occurred to me when looking at the class: there's a typo in the thread's name (line 68), don't think it's worth to open an own bug for this. ""CacheSweper"" probably should be ""CacheSweeper"".

```
**com.sun.messaging.ums.service.CacheSweeper.java** private static final String myName = ""CacheSweper"";

Now fixed ([diffs, Oracle only](https://adc4110323.us.oracle.com/hg/mq/MQ5.1.1/rev/b7fe2ec2298b)).

For all exceptions that were added in JMS 2.0 (<tt>IllegalStateRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>InvalidClientIDRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>InvalidDestinationRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>InvalidSelectorRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>JMSRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>JMSSecurityRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>MessageFormatRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>MessageNotWriteableRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>ResourceAllocationRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>TransactionInProgressRuntimeException</tt>, <tt>TransactionRolledBackRuntimeException</tt>), an explicit serialVersionUID has been set which matches the implicit serialVersionUID of the previous JMS 2.0 implementation.

This means that between the JMS 1.1 implementation and this new JMS 2.0 implementation there is full serialization compatibility (for those exceptions which exist in both versions).

Between the previous JMS 2.0 implementation and this new JMS 2.0 implementation there is serialization compatibility for the new exceptions added in JMS 2.0\.

However between the previous JMS 2.0 implementation and this new JMS 2.0 implementation there is no longer any serialization compatibility for the older exception classes that were originally defined prior to JMS 2.0\.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTQ0NQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

About one hour is spent on queries like ""DELETE FROM MQMSG41Cjms WHERE DESTINATION_ID = 'Q:somerandomqueue' AND STORE_SESSION_ID IN (SELECT ID FROM MQSES41Cjms WHERE BROKER_ID = 'brokername1')\G"".
This will endup using the Primary key:
MQMSG41Cjms | CREATE TABLE `MQMSG41Cjms` (
`ID` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
`MESSAGE` longblob NOT NULL,
`MESSAGE_SIZE` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
`STORE_SESSION_ID` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
`DESTINATION_ID` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
`TRANSACTION_ID` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
`CREATED_TS` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (`ID`),
KEY `MQMSG41CjmsIDX1` (`STORE_SESSION_ID`,`DESTINATION_ID`),
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ,
which will endup doing a scan on the first key STORE_SESSION_ID, and thus parsing the entire table for each queue.
In my case this takes about 350s/queue, the more queues the worse the startup time.

Adding the index :
create index DESTINATION_ID_idx on MQMSG41Cjms(DESTINATION_ID) reduces the start time on both OpenMQ4.5.2 and 5.1 to about 20 minutes, with no downside for our producers/consumers, perhaps with a marginal improvement on throughput.

I suggest adding the index in default properties for mysql InnoDb jdbc persistence.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTQ5Mg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

The application is configured to use one single connection (for the entire jvm) with reconnect and ping enabled and then one session and one topic on that connection (reusing the same session and topic for the entire lifetime of the cleint application / jvm). Then we creating and close multiple consumers multiple consumers throught the lifetime of the application (always reusing the same session)

Even though we have configured imqReconnectEnabled, the application gets to a state where any attempts to create a new consumer throws:
```
[C4001]: Write packet failed. - cause: java.net.SocketException: Socket closed

This is how we are configuring the connection:

cf.setProperty(ConnectionConfiguration.imqAddressList, imqAddressList);
// This property indicates whether the Sun MQ Client Application will attempt to reconnect to the Sun MQ Message
// Service upon losing
// its connection.
cf.setProperty(ConnectionConfiguration.imqReconnectEnabled, ""true"");
//This property holds the number of reconnect attempts for each address
//in the <code>imqAddressList</code> property that the Sun MQ Client
//Application will make before moving on the the next address in <code>imqAddressList</code>.
cf.setProperty(ConnectionConfiguration.imqReconnectAttempts, ""-1"");

//interval, in milliseconds, between
// successive reconnect attempts made by the MQ Client Application
// to the Sun MQ Message Service.
cf.setProperty(ConnectionConfiguration.imqReconnectInterval, ""3000"");

//This property defines the socket timeout, in milliseconds, used when a TCP connection is made to the broker.
//A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. The connection will then block until established or
//an error occurs. This property is used when connecting to the port mapper as well as when connecting to the required service.
cf.setProperty(ConnectionConfiguration.imqSocketConnectTimeout, ""3000"");

//This property specifies the 'ping' interval, in seconds, between successive attempts made by an MQ Connection
//to verify that its physical connection to the MQ broker is still functioning properly.
cf.setProperty(ConnectionConfiguration.imqPingInterval, ""10"");

//If this property is set to true, the MQ Client Runtime will abort the connection to the MQ broker when timeout,
//as specified by imqPingAckTimeout, in waiting for a 'ping' reply or any data sent from the MQ broker since
//last 'ping', then the MQ Client Runtime will perform actions as if the connection is broken.
cf.setProperty(ConnectionConfiguration.imqAbortOnPingAckTimeout, ""true"");

//When imqAbortOnPingAckTimeout is true, this property specifies maximum time, in milliseconds, that MQ Client
//Runtime will wait for a ping reply or any data sent from the MQ broker since last 'ping'.
//This property is ignored if imqAbortOnPingAckTimeout is false.
cf.setProperty(ConnectionConfiguration.imqPingAckTimeout, ""10000"");

connection = (com.sun.messaging.jms.Connection) cf.createConnection(""guest"", ""guest"");
connection.setExceptionListener(this);
connection.setEventListener(this);
log.debug(""Starting JMS connection"");
connection.start();
```
Is the glassfish jms client supposed to reestablish the underlying connection preserving any created sessions and Topics or is it that in the event of a connection becoming stale (as in this example the socket getting closed) any sessions under that connection also become stale and it is the responsability of the application to create a new session?

I'm assessing this bug for consideration for MS 5.1.1. Unfortunately the [email thread](https://java.net/projects/mq/lists/users/archive/2015-03/message/0)  is unavailable because of the move from java.net to GitHub so don't have very much information to go on. I did try to reproduce this but without success. 

The issue doesn't describe the mode of failure that led to this error (e.g. whether there was a single broker which failed and was restarted, or whether there was a broker cluster and one of the brokers failed). 

As a general comment, with the above connection parameters set then if the broker goes down the connection will attempt to reconnect and re-establish the connection. However a look at the code suggests that although the Connection object should remain valid after a reconnection, the Session may not and it may be necessary for the application to create a new Session. 

However using a stale Session to create a consumer would generate a different exception (`[C4001]: Write packet failed., packet type = CREATE_DESTINATION(34)`), and I can't reproduce the SocketException reported above.

Since this issue is over two years old I'm going to close it as not reproduceable. If more information is available please log a new bug.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTUxMw==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This includes <tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.JMSContextImpl</tt> and <tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.XAJMSContextImpl</tt>, which contain checks on the methods <tt>createContext</tt>, <tt>setClientID</tt>, <tt>setMessageListener</tt> amongst others.

These tests use a method <tt>getContainerType</tt> on the connection factory to determine what kind of environment the method is being called in.

In general, this returns <tt>ContainerType.JavaSE</tt> except for <tt>com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.XAConnectionFactory#getContainerType()</tt> which uses JNDI is used to determine whether the code is running in a Java EE web or EJB container.

This is a bit inconsistent but that's not the issue here.

The problem is that these classes shouldn't really be enforcing these restrictions at all. In a Java EE environment, these classes are intended to be wrapped by a resource adapter (or by other wrappers provided by the application server). They aren't intended to be used directly by applications. Responsibility for enforcing these restrictions lies with the resource adapter or wrapper.

However, the fact that these classes do enforce these restrictions prevents the use of methods such as <tt>setMessageListener</tt> by a resource adapter or by app server wrapper classes, despite this being perfectly legal. The prohibition on calling certain methods applies to applications, not to app server integration code (though perhaps the spec could be clearer).

Enforcing these restrictions at this level may cause difficulties for app server and resource adapter vendors. This applies particularly to the restrictions enforced by <tt>XAJMSContextImpl</tt>, which, after all, is expressly intended for use by app server and resource adapter vendors only.

So, it is hereby proposed to remove the enforcement of these restrictions from the MQ client.

To conform to the JMS specification, this means extra checks may be needed at resource adapter level, such as in JMSRA.

As is stated in the description, the purpose of this change is to make it more likely that the JMSRA resource adapter will work with application servers other than GlassFish.

In practice, however, this resource adapter is only ever used with GlassFish and there is no specific requirement to support other application servers. However JMSRA has never been formally tested with other application servers and if this were tried then it is very likely that other issues would be encountered.

In addition, this appears to be just a hypothetical issue that was reported by reading the code. This issue was not reported in response to actually trying to use JMSRA with a particular application server.

Given that there has never been a requirement for JMSRA to support application servers other than GlassFish, I am going to close this issue. If such a requirement emerges in the future a new issue should be logged.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTUzNg==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

```
<connector xmlns=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee""

```

It also declares only three of the many properties supported on the managed connection factory.

```

<managedconnectionfactory-class>
    com.sun.messaging.jms.ra.ManagedConnectionFactory

            </connection-definition>
```

This leaves many important properties undeclared, most notably <tt>clientId</tt>.

The JCA 1.7 spec section 18.5.1, ""Discovery of Configuration Properties"" states:

> Configuration tools provided by the container must introspect the JavaBeans listed in Section 18.5 ""ConfigProperty"" above for Connector 1.6 resource adapters to automatically discover the configuration properties of a JavaBean through JavaBeans introspection.
> 
> The resource adapter developer is, therefore, not required to annotate every property of the JavaBean with the ConfigProperty annotation. The resource adapter developer may only annotate specific properties of a JavaBean with the ConfigProperty annotation to specify non-default values. For example, when a property is required to be hidden from a configuration tool, the resource adapter provider need only annotate that property in the JavaBean with the ConfigProperty annotation and specifying the ignore annotation element as true.

This means that although many important properties are not declared, the fact that ra.xml states the JCA version to be 1.5 means that the application server is not required to use introspection to discover them.

This has an implication for the <tt>@JMSConnectionFactoryDefinition</tt> annotation. It means that if the JCA version is 1.5 or earlier, application servers do not have to support properties that are not declared in ra.xml. This means that jmsra may not work correctly with such application servers.

To fix this issue, either upgrade the JCA version to 1.6 or later or else declare every supported property (especially <tt>clientId</tt>) in <tt>ra.xml</tt>.

For your case, a few things should be checked first - any exception or error in broker and GlassFish server logs; does your application close/recreate consumers; if your application component uses any other framework (besides Java EE) to create JMS consumers under the cover; check your application if message processing path blocked that prevented message getting acknowledged hence the 'UnAck' count

1\. The PoolingException was from GlassFish server - either your GlassFish server configuration needs to be adjusted or a GlassFish server issue that you'd need to contact GlassFish (GlassFish support or GlassFish user's forum or GLASSFISH jira)
2\. The B1389 broker log message is an INFO log message

The place in the code is obvious:

For non expired messages the API user has to free take care about freeing the memory using the cshim function MQFreeMessage. As the expired messages are not provided to the user API no freeing happens in the current code, resulting in a leak for every single expired message.

Dear OpenMQ contributors/experts,

Our heap analysis has shown an OpenMQ 5.1 ""SessionRead"" attached to a Thread & referenced a ProtocolHanlder. ProtocolHanlder#requestMetaData strongly referenced hundreds of thousands of AsyncSendCallback.

We've looked into ProtocolHanlder, then ConnectionImpl, then ReadChannel, since their ""requestMetaData"" reference exactly same instance. ConnectionImpl does almost nothing w/ requestMetaData. ProtocolHanlder only puts AsyncSendCallback into requestMetaData and never removes out.

ReadChannel#asyncSendAcknowledge ""get"" AsyncSendCallback from requestMetaData and eventually invokes CompletionListener. SHouldn't ReadChannel#asyncSendAcknowledge removes the acknowledged AsyncSendCallback as well? Otherwise, just like us observed, requestMetaData accumulates hundreds of thousands of AsyncSendCallback, and growing, until out of memory or too slow not to restart.

Amy:

Yes, it should have removed it from requestMetaData - that looks like an oversight. Thanks for reporting this. Please file a bug at
[https://java.net/jira/browse/MQ](https://java.net/jira/browse/MQ)

P.S.

Hashtable uses lock, therefore slow. Both replaceProducerID & replaceConsumerID does ""requestMetaData.remove(ackID)"" right after ""requestMetaData.get(ackID)"", those 2 steps can totally merged to just ""got = requestMetaData.remove(ackID)""

{2} doesn't get replaced with a destination name because it isn't passed to the logger:

Hi.
Regarding this amendment, I have one question.

The part of {2} is not replaced.

        B1277=Reconstruct message {0} for destination {1}

The cause is that this class subclasses <tt>ConcurrentHashMap</tt>.

In Java 7 <tt>ConcurrentHashMap#keySet()</tt> returns a <tt>Set</tt>
In Java 8 <tt>ConcurrentHashMap#keySet()</tt> returns a KeySetView<K, V> (which implements Set)

We therefore need to change <tt>PHashMap#keySet()</tt> so that it returns a <tt>KeySetView<K, V></tt>.

There is no requirement to be able to compile the MQ 5.1.1 source using Java 8\. However this will doubtless be a requirement of a future version of MQ.

tsyama said:
""__JMQAdmin"" is the Physical Destination that the broker create automatically when the imqcmd are executed.
Connecting with the broker, the imqcmd requests the broker to (1) and (2) processing.
(1) Create ""__JMQAdmin""
(2) Add producer on ""__JMQAdmin""
It seems that the avobe failure occurs when ""__JMQAdmin"" is deleted between (1) and (2).

Receiving the request of (1), the broker confirms if the connection is AdminConnection,
adds DestType.DEST_ADMIN, DestType.DEST_LOCAL and DestType.DEST_AUTO to
the original type of destination only in the case of AdminConnection.

*   com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.data.handlers.DestinationHandler#handle(IMQConnection con, Packet msg)```
    if (con.isAdminConnection()) {
       type |= DestType.DEST_ADMIN | DestType.DEST_LOCAL 
             | DestType.DEST_AUTO;
    }
    ```

On the other hand, receiving the request of (2),
the broker doesn't confirm if the connection is AdminConnection, the destination type is not change.

*   com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.data.handlers.ProducerHandler#handle(IMQConnection con, Packet msg)

If ""__JMQAdmin"" is deleted between (1) and (2), the broker is going to create ""__JMQAdmin"" at (2).
But the imqcmd command ends in failure because the broker throws BrokerException when ""com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.core.Destination"" is instantiated.

```
if (!DestType.isAdmin(type) && !canAutoCreate(DestType.isQueue(type),type) && !BrokerMonitor.isInternal(destination)) {
    throw new BrokerException(
            Globals.getBrokerResources().getKString(
            BrokerResources.W_DST_NO_AUTOCREATE,
             getName()),
            BrokerResources.W_DST_NO_AUTOCREATE,
            (Throwable) null,
            Status.FORBIDDEN);
```

When this happend, the property ""imq.autocreate.queue"" is false.

This failure might be fixed by confirming if the connection is AdminConnection and adding DestType.DEST_ADMIN, DestType.DEST_LOCAL and DestType.DEST_AUTO to the destination type when the broker receives the request of (2).

But this fix cause another problem with the multiple executions of the imqcmd.
The following error message appeared when a lot of imqcmd commands are executed at the same time.

> 3 09, 2016 10:23:14 AM com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsclient.ExceptionHandler logCaughtException

The broker logged the following message at this time.

> [B4063]: Can not create Destination __JMQAdmin [Queue] - the destination already exists

It may happens when creating the destination object conflicts at (2).
One imqcmd process creates ""__JMQAdmin"" and puts it into the list of destinations managed by a broker,
and the other one put ""__JMQAdmin"" which created at the same time into the list,
the broker throws the BrokerException through the following part.

```
synchronized (destinationList) {
          Destination newd = (Destination)destinationList.get(duid);
          if (newd != null) { // updating existing
              throw new BrokerException(""Destination already exists"");
          }
```

I think it only have to change BrokerException to ConflictException to fix it.
ConflictException will be caught by invoker method immediately,
""__JMQAdmin"" are taken out from the list at the time, and then, the broker carrys on the processing.
As a result, multiple executions of the imqcmd would not be failure.

Please refer to the following diff about a suggested fix.

tsyama said:
OpenMQ 5.1 becomes this error, too.

I propose an another idea that is better than before.

__JMQAdmin had been deleted by the timer task to delete __JMQAdmin automatically.
The imqcmd command internally create the producer to __JMQAdmin, and the timer task is scheduled by this producer when the producer is closed and disconnect from the broker.

It's not necessary to delete __JMQAdmin because imqcmd command surely use it when the command works.
Therefore, I think that I should correct logic so as not to schedule the timer task to delete __JMQAdmin automatically at the end of the work of the imqcmd command.
The imqbridgemgr command also similarly schedules the timer task to delete __JMQBridgeAdmin automatically.
I think that this is also unnecessary.

There is no connection from Consumer though in __JMQAdmin and __JMQBridgeAdmin, there is a connection from producer.
Therefore, I think that only the correction of logic concerning scheduling the timer task by the disconnection from producer is necessary.
If the imqcmd command is not executed after the broker starts, __JMQAdmin is unnecessary.
Therefore, I think that the broker need not generate __JMQAdmin at the time of starup.

I propose the following correction methods for the reasons mentioned above.

It continuously monitors ""available memory"" and determines its own ""usage level"":

*   GREEN: ""Plenty of memory is available""
*   YELLOW (default: 80% memory usage): ""Broker memory is beginning to run low""
*   ORANGE (default: 90% memory usage): ""The broker is low on memory""
*   RED (default: 98% memory usage): ""The broker is out of memory""

Beginning with YELLOW level, the broker starts swapping messages to persistent storage, limits producers and - when reaching the RED level, rejects new producers.
Associated messages from log.txt:

[B1089]: In low memory condition, Broker is attempting to free up resources
WARNING [B2076]: Broker is rejecting new producers, because it is extremely low on memory

The theory behind this seems to be that you can actually ""free"" memory and thus prevent a memory overload in time.

**Unfortunately, JVM memory management doesn't work this way.**

When using the configuration shipped with Glassfish 4.1.1, the maximum heap size is set to 192m and the default garbage collector is used. The JVM heap is thus divided into

*   OldGen space: ~128m (67%)
*   Eden space: ~50m (26%)
*   Survivor spaces: 2x ~7m (7%)
    Only one of the survivor spaces can be used at a time, so the value returned by Runtime.maxMemory is not 192m but ~185m.

New objects are allocated in the Eden space. When it runs full, a ""minor GC"" is triggered and surviving objects are moved to one of the Survivor spaces (or directly to OldGen if they exceed 7m). When the survivor space runs full, objects are moved to the OldGen. When the OldGen runs full, a ""full GC"" is triggered. When the full GC cannot free up memory, you get an OutOfMemoryError.

All this happens in the background. Especially the ""full GC"" is a costly operation that is run rarely by a JVM. This means that

*   The ""available memory"" calculated by the broker is the sum of unused memory in all areas of the heap.
*   Since the Eden space is cleared frequently while the JVM is running, this amount of ""available memory"" is expected to vary by +/- 26% just by running the broker.
*   Once an object reaches the OldGen, its memory will not be freed until the next full GC, no matter what you do. You can't ""free up resources"" and expect the memory allocation level to decrease instantly.
*   A full GC is triggered as late as possible - that is when memory allocation reaches 100%.

The effects I observed were the following:

*   Just connecting JConsole to an otherwise idle broker process can cause a RED memory condition within a few hours, where the usage level oscillates between YELLOW/ORANGE/RED in the last minutes (remember: 26% variation) before the JVM triggers a full GC and usage level drops back to GREEN for the next few hours.

*   The same happens when there is a constant but slow flow of messages. With an example application, I initially produced 1000 messages, each 700 bytes in size. The application then started removing the oldest messages and producing a new one each time.
    With this setup, the memory used by messages in the broker was ~700k at any point in time. Nevertheless the broker quickly ran into a RED memory condition and rejected new messages for a few seconds - until the JVM triggered a full GC.

The cause seems to be that the Eden space fills up very quickly when messages are sent to the broker (I assume a lot of copying data between byte or char arrays that are not reused). The messages themselves stay in the queue for some time and therefore get moved to the OldGen. Once there, the memory is not reclaimed until the next full GC even though they are not referenced anymore.

The only reasonable measure to prevent the broker from rejecting producers for some minutes every few hours is to disable the RED memory level by setting imq.red.threshold=100.

Since you CAN NOT KNOW the amount of memory that is really ""available"", i.e. the result of the next GC, this kind of ""memory management"" makes it easy for any client to put the broker into a DoS condition.

The syntax for message selectors is defined in the javadoc for <tt>javax.jms.Message</tt>. This states:

Now a string that contains one space is not, strictly speaking, an ""empty string"", since the method <tt>isEmpty</tt> would return false. So the specification is a little vague. However it seems reasonable to treat it like an empty string, and as you observe that's what <tt>ProtocolHandler</tt> does on the remote client before the selector is passed to the server. However in embedded mode the <tt>ProtocolHandler</tt> is by-passed, and from your report it appears that a <tt>SelectorFormatException</tt> is thrown.

I think from your opinion it seems that REMOTE operation is correct behaviour and EMBEDDED operation is mistaken.

A … EMBEDDED operation

A and B are opposite.
Is that so?

When you try to generate the Browser instance, in each of the operating method, the results will differ.

**A: EMBEDDED operation**
Call the createBrowser method with a single-byte space character to MessageSelector.
ex) browser = JMSContext.createBrowser (Queue, "" "")

At JMSServiceImpl of class addBrowser method, there is a process to invoke the compile method of the Selector class, In the same place, exception SelectorFormatException occurs, it fails to generate the instance.

**B. REMOTE operation**
As well as the A calls the createBrowser method.
At verifyDestination method of ProtocolHandler class, the value of MessageSelector is Null or, empty, in the case of a single-byte blank, All there is processing that is Null, and later because it is treated as Null, generation of the instance is completed successfully.

As the behavior of the A and B, and which is correct?

Using Open MQ version is 5.1_b09.

The syntax for message selectors is defined in the javadoc for <tt>javax.jms.Message</tt>. This states:

> If the value of a message selector is an empty string, the value is treated as a null and indicates that there is no message selector for the message consumer.

Now a string that contains one space is not, strictly speaking, an ""empty string"", since the method <tt>isEmpty</tt> would return false. So the specification is a little vague. However it seems reasonable to treat it like an empty string, and as you observe that's what <tt>ProtocolHandler</tt> does on the remote client before the selector is passed to the server. However in embedded mode the <tt>ProtocolHandler</tt> is by-passed, and from your report it appears that a <tt>SelectorFormatException</tt> is thrown.

So A is the correct behaviour.

Thank you for answer.
I think from your opinion it seems that REMOTE operation is correct behaviour and EMBEDDED operation is mistaken.

> So A is the correct behaviour. Please report the exact exception and stack trace you get in case B,
A … EMBEDDED operation
B … REMOTE operation
A and B are opposite.
Is that so?

I report on an exact exception and the stack trace of the EMBEDDED operation.

We've had an app which has run for years under a similar load pattern under GF 3.1.2 and Java 7\. We have just tried porting to Glassfish 4.1.1.171 under Java 8 (Payara) and have seen a situation where we can deadlock the broker under Glassfish running in LOCAL mode. I haven't tried this in EMBEDDED or REMOTE. We have settings set to flow control mode, with a 1GB heap and the default cap of 100K messages. We have a batch process which runs, sending 500 messages at a time from a single producer for a total of about 1.25 million messages. We also have periodic additional producers which send single messages on the order of 10-20 per hour, which use a higher message priority

If the main bulk process is left uninterrupted, it tends to complete fine. If we turn on the other producers, eventually we will reach a situation where the broker hangs, and the DAS connections to the broker also seize up and the app becomes useless. This is inhibiting our ability to use this version of MQ and Glassfish. I am contemplating workarounds, such as using the version of OpenMQ which came with GF 3.1.2 as a separate service and running the GF4 JMSRA in REMOTE mode, but that is less than ideal.

Hello,

i try to bind JMS destination into JNDI. This will throw the following exception:

```

```

Example code:

```
public void onMessage(Message incomingMessage) {
		InitialContext ic;
		try {
			ic = new InitialContext();
			String jndiName = ""macd/research/ReplyDestination"";
			Destination replyDestination = incomingMessage.getJMSReplyTo();
			if (replyDestination instanceof Serializable) {
				System.out.println(""Destination is serializable!"");
			} else {
				System.out.println(""Destination is NOT serializable!"");
			}
			ic.bind(jndiName + ""Test"", replyDestination);
		} catch (NamingException e) {
			// ignore for testing
		} catch (JMSException e) {
			// ignore for testing
		}
	}
```

But the instanceof operation returns true. So the bind() method tries to
serialize the given object which cause mentioned exception. This happens if JMS
service type is set to ""embedded"". If i switch the type to ""local"" everything
works fine. In my opinion there is something wrong ![](https://java.net/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif). The instanceof operation
should return false if the object is not serializable.

We have run into a thread deadlock issue with one of our applications running on Glassfish 4 / MQ 5.0\. It appears that the issue is caused by the message queue broker, so please let me know if this is not the right location to file this issue.

The scenario is as follows:

*   Broker is running locally with a single message queue set to FLOW_CONTROL
*   Application contains multiple producers, each within their own session, for said queue. These producers have different life-cycles, some being kept alive for the duration of the application, some being created and closed more frequently.
*   MDBs are used to consume messages from the queue

Under load, we see that after some time both the producer as well as the consumer side in our application start outputting messages that indicate that the broker is no longer responding:

It is however still possible to connect to the broker using imqcmd.

A thread dump of the broker shows the following:

Found 1 deadlock.

Looking at the source for OpenMQ 5.0, there seems to be a race condition to acquire a lock on a producer. As best as I understand, the scenario is as follows:

Request to destroy Producer A locks A
Request to destroy Producer B locks B
Destination locks flow control to destroy A
Destination waits for lock on flow control to destroy B
Destination for A attempts to acquire lock for producer B (synchronized call to Producer.isValid)
#### Environment
Linux
#### Affected Versions
[4.0]

I am seeing a similar scenario, using the MQ 5.1.1 bundled with Payara 4.1.1.171\. Under some load, in a pattern which worked without issue under GF 3.1.2 and its broker, I am seeing a deadlock in the MQ process. I've seen it in as little as 40-50m, and as much as 7 hours. It seems to be exacerbated by the number of producers. If I can limit the number of producers, it seems less likely to happen.

My case is in Windows Server 2008 R2, with JDK 8u121, using the Payara 4.1.1.171 zip distribution of Glassfish, with the JMS broker running in FLOW_CONTROL mode, with a 1GB heap, and the default max of 100K messages for this particular queue.

I'm attaching three logs:
server.log - Glassfish log, the issues start around the 7h mark, on line 771
[https://paste.ee/p/kEmJO](https://paste.ee/p/kEmJO)

log.txt - OpenMQ log
[https://paste.ee/p/9drCs](https://paste.ee/p/9drCs)

jmq-lock.txt - jstack output showing the same deadlock as the original poster.
[https://paste.ee/p/iZmwf](https://paste.ee/p/iZmwf)

This is inhibiting our ability to move from GF 3.x to GF 4.x.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTc5OA==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

I've created a test case that reproduces the issue quite repeatedly - it's available on [github](https://github.com/jigga/xid-mismatch).

The test case consists of a batch job that contains a single chunk-style step with partition mapper (step's partitioned as the problem occurs in a concurrent environment). **ItemReader** creates random number (between MIN and MAX as defined in **SimplePartitionMapper**) of entity instances of type **Subscriber**. **ItemProcessor** does nothing, but sleeps for 50 ms. Item writer persists entities created by the reader and then publishes the collection of items to JMS topic (in a single distributed transaction) and here's where the problem occurs. Will try to provide the more detailed description of the test case in the README.md file on github.
#### Environment
Tested with glass fish-embedded on Windows 7 & Mac OSX 10.10.1
#### Affected Versions
[4.1]

Assuming the test case follows the JMS and Java EE spec (haven't looked at it myself) in using transaction, JMS Session, JMSContext etc., I suspect this is likely an issue with jms-service DIRECT (or EMBEDDED) mode for it uses a completely different path in JMSRA to interact with broker. I'd suggest first check the test case to ensure spec compliance, then try jms-service LOCAL mode.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDY3MTgxMQ==/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Nice test case. I ran it repeatedly (using `mvn clean test`) and it passed every time. Here's an example of the test output: [test.out.txt](https://github.com/javaee/openmq/files/1128398/test.out.txt)

I'm evaluating this issue for GlassFish 5.0 (MQ 5.1.1). Since this is a RI release, I need to consider whether or not this issue prevents GlassFish functioning as a RI. The fact that the issue was not seen when running the test case here suggests that the issue is intermittent and does not prevent it being used as a RI. I am therefore excluding it from 5.0.

I'll leave the issue open for now; if @jiggster or anyone would like to provide an updated test case this will be considered for a later release.

Under this comparison condition, loops will be repeated even if free memory is increased by GC execution, is there a problem ?
As GC repeats, the load on the CPU increases, so there is concern about the delay in message broker processing.

**com.sun.messaging.jmq.jmsserver.memory.MemoryManager:**
``` java
protected void gc(int count, long delta) { 
    if (!NO_GC) { 
    	 logger.log(Logger.DEBUG,""calling Runtime.freeMemory()""); 
        long free = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();  
        int i = 0; 
        for (i = 0; i < count; i ++) { 
            Runtime.getRuntime().gc(); 
            long newfree = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory(); 
/* => */    if (free - newfree > delta) {
                 // we freed enough memory 
                 break; 
            } 


        } 
    } 
    else{ 
    	// do nothing 
    	 
    } 
} 
```

Since this method is invoked when free memory decreases than before, 
and because we have ""we freed enough memory"" in the comment, 
I think that it is better to exit the loop if the free memory increases.

Using Open MQ version is 5.1.

### Proposed fix
Correct the condition so that when the free memory in the Java virtual machine increases, it leaves the loop.

#### Previous fix
``` java
if (free - newfree > delta) {
```

#### After fix
``` java
if (newfree - free > delta) {
```

The source of the deadlock seems to be a bug in OpenMQ in this code: https://github.com/javaee/openmq/blob/master/mq/main/mq-jmsra/jmsra-ra/src/main/java/com/sun/messaging/jms/ra/DirectXAResource.java#L396

I think that 2 associated resources are being closed at the same time when 2 parallel transactions are being committed and each other tries to find out whether the other one is completed. Since the call to `getResourceState()` is synchronized, both resources are stuck because they already hold the lock to themselves. Resource A holds the lock A and needs to get a lock B to find out the state of resource B, while resource B holds the lock B and needs the lock A to find out the state of resource A.

I believe this is a bug in OpenMQ and the call to `getResourceState` shouldn't be synchronized. Instead, it should return immediately and access to the value being returned should be synchronized, e.g. by using AtomicInteger instead of plain int, or using a separate lock not shared by the rest of the `DirectXAResource` class.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/397/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Successfully queried the destination.

After we get: Destroying auto-created destination testdel [Queue] inactive for 7200 seconds and destination destroyed message, we can still see queue with query dst.

calling destroy also has no effect
imqcmd -b  xx.xx.xx.xx:37676 -u admin -pw admin destroy dst -t q -n testdel

Query that should remove destination looks like this (for both reap and destroy):

DELETE FROM MQDST41Cmqm WHERE ID = 'Q:testdel' AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM MQMSG41Cmqm WHERE DESTINATION_ID = 'Q:testdel') AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM MQBKR41Cmqm WHERE ID <> 'b1'  AND STATE = 1)

From what i understand, the last  NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM MQBKR41Cmqm WHERE ID <> 'b1'  AND STATE = 1) would basicly translate into ""if there isn't any other active broker in cluster"" , so that means we cannot remove any autocreated destination if there are other active nodes in the cluster.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/402/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

@bshannon, @m0mus or other Oracle representatives may be able to help you further.
1. Is the library compatible with Java 11? 
    Yes, Although the official build runs against Java SE 8 now, it should build against Java 11 as long as all the build tools involved like Maven, Jenkins, etc. are fully compatible with it as well. I am not aware of internal or other problematic code being used (like ""misc.unsafe"") in OpenMQ, again the Oracle reps in Jakarta EE or the EE4J PMC could tell you more.
2. Is the library supported with Java 11?
   Not sure, if the question is phrased correctly, but I guess it should mean, if Jakarta EE/OpenMQ officially support Java 11? That is a ""No"" at this point, but the first Jakarta EE build (Glassfish) may well run on top of Java 11, especially since it offers a LTS option, but that is up to each vendor. Glassfish is the ""Spec Implementation"" so any vendor using it, e.g. Payara will choose their preferred JDK whether that is 9, 10 or 11 or higher, is up to them.

There are two places causing trouble for JDK11 build:
1. https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/blob/e202722d986ed1dd2bcb32998b834e5fae750bbb/mq/main/mq-broker/cluster/src/main/java/com/sun/messaging/jmq/jmsserver/multibroker/heartbeat/HeartbeatService.java#L217-L225
There is no longer method `Thread.destroy`, thus `@Override` causes compilation error.
2. In `packager-opensource` - for `buildexamples` task - classes from `javax.xml.soap` package missing (moved to module not added by default I guess).

But your **this place** points to 5.1.3 bundles, so which one you are using
1. cloned repository or 
2. package of tagged tree?

(Not important because:)

When I tried to reproduce your problem (with empty maven repo and no local cache) with `tar.gz` - I got following:
```

[WARNING] The POM for jakarta.jms:jakarta.jms-api:jar:2.0.1 is missing, no dependency information available
```
I have jms-api:2.0.1 cached from staging, but it seems to be missing *now* in sonatype repo (https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/staging/jakarta/jms/jakarta.jms-api/)

My primary intend was to get it into glassfish 6 delivery.
I inspected the branch 6.0.0-M1 which is missing all commits of 15 April 2020.
Therefore this fix is also missing and was not delivered with the first glassfish 6 milestone.
Why is that? What am I overlooking?

""-target"" is listed as a required option. However, it is not really necessary.The ""-f"" option can also be specified.

## Steps to reproduce
```
C:\glassfish5\mq\bin>imqusermgr encode -src C:\test.txt -f

Thanks a lot, this very helpful. I need release dependencies and have already found appropriated solution: [Github Packages](https://github.com/bvfalcon?page=1&repo_name=eclipse-openmq&tab=packages) can be used as Maven repository.

But of course mq-distribution with zip-type artifact absolutely not enough. For example, I want to write test-module for Apache Camel using Open MQ [instead of Active MQ](https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/main/test-infra/camel-test-infra-activemq/pom.xml#L61-L95). How can I do this with only zip-artifact?
This is only one case, where Open MQ subsystems as maven dependencies can be used. They can be dozen for 10 minutes invented.

The mq-client artifact looks like it could be the right dependency.
I replaced the dependency on imq with mq-client for testing purpose.

Unfortunately this can not be tested with my project, because it is based on:
- Glassfish 6.0.0 (OpenMQ 6.1)
- Jakarta 9.0
- Java SE 8

The OpenMQ 6.4.0-SNAPSHOT artifacts currently
- don't fit together in minor version (6.4 <-> 6.1)
- is incompatible in class file version (class file has wrong version 55.0, should be 52.0)

As soon as my project is sufficiently advanced in the migration with Jakarta and Java SE, this can be tested again.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/comments/IC_kwDOBv29P85QvZYo/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

This issue is reproduced with the latest MQ with the latest OpenJDK 11.

It is probably because Password.getPasswordFromJavaConsole() call java.io.Console.readPassword() with null arg, which causes an internal NPE. I think it can be called without arguments here. (Password.java#L45)

This seems to be caused by a change in OpenJDK. (NPE occured at Console.java#L324)

* GlassFish 6.2.3-SNAPSHOT (HEAD:ad6fefc)
* Openmq 6.3.0-SNAPSHOT (HEAD:7c55002)

## Problem Description
The following properties affect the default values for manually created physical destinations
- imq.autocreate.destination.maxNumProducers
- imq.autocreate.queue.maxNumActiveConsumers
- imq.autocreate.queue.maxNumBackupConsumers
- imq.autocreate.queue.consumerFlowLimit
- imq.autocreate.queue.localDeliveryPreferred
- imq.autocreate.destination.useDMQ

These are properties for autocreate and should not affect the default values for manually created physical destinations.

# `TrustManager` that accepts all certificates

If the checkServerTrusted method of a TrustManager never throws a CertificateException, it trusts every certificate. This allows an attacker to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack against the application, therefore breaking any security Transport Layer Security (TLS) gives.

An attack might look like this:

1.    The vulnerable program connects to https://example.com.
1.    The attacker intercepts this connection and presents a valid, self-signed certificate for https://example.com.
1.    The vulnerable program calls the checkServerTrusted method to check whether it should trust the certificate.
1.    The checkServerTrusted method of your TrustManager does not throw a CertificateException.
1.    The vulnerable program accepts the certificate and proceeds with the connection since your TrustManager implicitly trusted it by not throwing an exception.
1.    The attacker can now read the data your program sends to https://example.com and/or alter its replies while the program thinks the connection is secure.

## Recommendation

Do not use a custom TrustManager that trusts any certificate. If you have to use a self-signed certificate, don't trust every certificate, but instead only trust this specific certificate. See below for an example of how to do this.
Example

In the first (bad) example, the TrustManager never throws a CertificateException and therefore implicitly trusts any certificate. This allows an attacker to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack. In the second (good) example, the self-signed certificate that should be trusted is loaded into a KeyStore. This explicitly defines the certificate as trusted and there is no need to create a custom TrustManager.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    {
        class InsecureTrustManager implements X509TrustManager {
            @Override

                // BAD: Does not verify the certificate chain, allowing any certificate.
            }

            @Override
            public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) throws CertificateException {

            }

Right.

To clarify: my adjective ""invalid"" in https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/1431#issuecomment-1086842613 was the reference to the title, not the status of the issue itself.
As the original report here does not mention any details what is _invalid_ in RA DD, and _enabled some tests_ does not help me much - I linked the one that I think has it described.

Seems like the error is caused because of simultaneous iterating over consumerEventListeners's keySet via iterator and adding/removing entires of this HashMap. 

According to HashMap's javadoc:

> The iterators returned by all of this class's ""collection view methods"" are fail-fast: if the map is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove method, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.

Unfortunately, I cannot share the code reproducing given error due to the company's policy, but schema is plain simple: you just have to add/remove new instances of com.sun.messaging.jms.notification.EventListener to single reused com.sun.messaging.jms.Connection, while sending messages via given connection. After running this cycle for about 5-7 minutes exception occurs.

header-value        = *<any OCTET except CR or LF or "":"">

A colon character must be escaped/un-escaped using \c (see section ""Value Encoding""):
> When decoding frame headers, the following transformations MUST be applied:
>     \r (octet 92 and 114) translates to carriage return (octet 13)

https://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html

In the stomp bridge, this transformation seems to be missing, which causes errors for example for ACK frames and for temporary queue destinations.

Note: the issue only exists with clients which use Stomp protocol above 1.0, so the workaround is to stay on Stomp 1.0.

My ECA, which I signed yesterday, is not approved yet. Maybe this was caused by using my 'anonymous' info@...' email address. I have already changed this in my GitHub profile but the PR still indicates the error.

Regarding 1.2 support, in the Stomp protocol negotiation, Stomp 1.0 and 1.2 are handled as supported (in method getSupportedVersions() for the regular StompProtocolHandlerImpl). I have not further checked the WebSocket StompProtocolHandlerImpl, but it seems it supports only Stomp 1.2 as this is the only version returned by getSupportedVersions(). 

Most parts of Stomp 1.2 seem to be already implemented according to the specification. The methods which encode / decode Stomp frame header do not apply the escape / unescape. I will create a new issue soon.

As a direct consequence, some frames which work correctly with Stomp 1,0 will no longer be correct with Stomp 1.2.

```
The commands and headers are encoded in UTF-8. All frames except the CONNECT and CONNECTED frames will also escape any carriage return, line feed or colon found in the resulting UTF-8 encoded headers.

Escaping is needed to allow header keys and values to contain those frame header delimiting octets as values. The CONNECT and CONNECTED frames do not escape the carriage return, line feed or colon octets in order to remain backward compatible with STOMP 1.0.

C style string literal escapes are used to encode any carriage return, line feed or colon that are found within the UTF-8 encoded headers. When decoding frame headers, the following transformations MUST be applied:

    \r (octet 92 and 114) translates to carriage return (octet 13)
    \n (octet 92 and 110) translates to line feed (octet 10)
    \c (octet 92 and 99) translates to : (octet 58)
    \\ (octet 92 and 92) translates to \ (octet 92)

Undefined escape sequences such as \t (octet 92 and 116) MUST be treated as a fatal protocol error. Conversely when encoding frame headers, the reverse transformation MUST be applied.

The STOMP 1.0 specification included many example frames with padding in the headers and many servers and clients were implemented to trim or pad header values. This causes problems if applications want to send headers that SHOULD not get trimmed. In STOMP 1.2, clients and servers MUST never trim or pad headers with spaces.
```


OpenMQ does not apply the transformations for carriage return, line feed or colon octets and for the backslash character.

Proposal:
With this issue the implementation of the transformations will be addressed. Other parts of this specification section will be implemented with subsequent issues.

Other notes: 
* with the changes in pull request #1533 the stomp version information is accessible in the stomp frame handler
* issue #1522 may be closed (duplicate)

> I believe this top-level license file is actually the license file from OpenMQ. The way OpenMQ is included in the build is essentially by unpacking mq-dist.zip into the Payara install. Previously the license file for OpenMQ was under `mq/legal` and it has now been moved to be in the top-level of the zip (as in it's _above_ `mq`). Under the same logic, I think the `NOTICE.md` file is also coming from OpenMQ.

It's very possible for them to come from OpenMQ indeed.

I suggest to adjust this here as well.

`LICENSE.md` is there (in top-level directory) - since 5.1.3 (first release after donation to EF), and was not there before (5.1.2-b01).
It's exactly the same file:
```
$ diff -s ./LICENSE.md ./mq/legal/LICENSE.txt
Files ./LICENSE.md and ./mq/legal/LICENSE.txt are identical
```
I believe `NOTICE.md` can land in `mq/legal` too, then top-level directory would contain `mq` only and all files would be in _installation_ dir.","{""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues/1556/reactions"", ""total_count"": 0, ""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""heart"": 0, ""rocket"": 0, ""eyes"": 0}"

Because the port is different almost every time it won't work with simple port forwarding in vagrant or docker. It is possible to forward port ranges but that beats the whole purpose of isolating an app. And its not clear to me what the ranges are.

In my case the client would create a connection on localhost:7676 and then when going back it will print out an error 
```
Error occurred on connection creation [localhost:43489]. - cause: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)

Fails because dynamic port 43489 is not exposed on the app server container.

It all depends on OS.

```
$ rpm -ql nspr-devel | grep prtypes.h
/usr/include/nspr4/prtypes.h

$ rpm -ql nss-devel | grep nss.h
/usr/include/nss3/nss.h
```

For compilation you have to adjust properties:
```
$ grep -E ""linux.*include.*(nss|nspr)"" mq/src/buildant/default.properties
mqcrt.cincludes.dbg.linux=-I${nsprhome.dbg.linux}/include/nspr -I${nsshome.dbg.linux}/include/nss

This improvement will enhance the functionality of the OpenMQ build by publishing build scans to [develocity-staging.eclipse.org](https://develocity-staging.eclipse.org/), hosted by the Eclipse Foundation and run in partnership between the Eclipse Foundation and Gradle. This Develocity is freely available for use by the Eclipse OpenMQ project and all other Eclipse projects.

On this Develocity instance, the Eclipse OpenMQ project will have access not only to all of the published build scans but also to other aggregate data features such as:

* Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance [trends](https://develocity-staging.eclipse.org/scans/trends?search.relativeStartTime=P28D&trends.timeResolution=week) over time
* [Build failure analytics](https://develocity-staging.eclipse.org/scans/failures?search.relativeStartTime=P28D) for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures
* [Test failure analytics](https://develocity-staging.eclipse.org/scans/tests?search.relativeStartTime=P28D) to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests

This will also enable you to (optionally) use build time optimization features, such as build caching and Predictive Test Selection. 

More information can be read in the [Eclipse announcement](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg20000.html). 

**IMPORTANT:** If your project is interested in being a part of this initiative, please reach out to Eclipse infra by filling out a [helpdesk ticket](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/new) to get the CI setup and credentials.
