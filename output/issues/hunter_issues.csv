issue,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hunter/issues/2,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hunter/issues/2,hunter,I_kwDOF9FF7c4_wJ1-,2,Extend --magnitude to support specific metrics,smccarthy788,MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDEyODE=,Sean McCarthy,,OPEN,2021-12-02T14:05:07Z,2022-03-25T09:11:12Z,"Users report wanting to filter different metrics at different magnitudes (e.g. p99 vs p50). However, the `--magnitude` argument filters across all metrics.

One option could be to allow setting multiple `metric=min_magnitude` pairs with the `--magnitude` flag, or exclusively a single float. This would be pretty verbose... Ex:
```bash
hunter ... --magnitude p50=0.05 --magnitude p99=0.2
```

Another option would be setting the `min_magnitude` in the config for each test's metric, with support for inheritance so each test doesn't need to define it. This option should also support overriding the config.
```yaml
templates:
  common_metrics:
    metrics:
      p50:
        scale: 1.0e-6
        direction: -1
