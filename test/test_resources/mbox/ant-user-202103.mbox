The ApacheCon Planners and the Apache Software Foundation are pleased to 
announce that ApacheCon@Home will be held online, September 21-23, 2021. 
Once again, we’ll be featuring content from dozens of our projects, as 
well as content about our community, how Apache works, business models 
around Apache software, the legal aspects of open source, and many other 
topics.

Last year’s virtual ApacheCon@Home event was a big success, with 5,745 
registrants from more than 150 countries, spanning every time zone, with 
the virtual format delivering content to attendees who would never have 
attended an in-person ApacheCon (83% of post-event poll responders in 
2020 indicated this was their first ApacheCon ever)!

Given the great participation and excitement for last year’s event, we 
are announcing the Call for Presentations is now open to presenters from 
around the world until May 1st. Talks can be focused on the topics 
above, as well as any of our amazing projects. Submit your talks today!

We look forward to reviewing your contribution to one of the most 
popular open source software events in the world!


Rich, for the ApacheCon Planners
